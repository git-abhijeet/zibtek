    "extractedText": "+1 (385) 832 6227\nContact\nPractical Agile Development Services\nOur Software Development Process\nRequest Information\nSelect Inquiry Type\nSubmit now\nOur Software Development Process\nWhat is a practical agile approach to software development? At Zibtek , it's a combination of:\nHigh-Trust, Self-Organized Teams Who Understand Specific Business Needs.\nPrinciples And Practices That Can Easily Be Combined With A Variety Of Approaches.\nStaying Focused On The Rapid Development And Deployment Of Software.\nAt Zibtek, good software development starts with a great idea. From concept to solution, we work with you to plan, develop, test, deliver, and assess your software needs. Our practical approach transforms the agile process from a mystifying undertaking to one where transparency and communication keep our clients happy!\nPre-Project Consultation\nPreventing failure during the software development process begins with avoiding failure in the planning stage. Each project starts with a solid strategy used to build out a complete proposal and becomes the launch point for development. To determine your goals and objectives, we consult with you to better understand what you do and what you want to accomplish.\nAssess Fit\nAre we the right cultural fit for each other? Can we deliver the product you want and deserve?\nRefine Idea\nWe ask questions—lots of questions! We want to fully understand your technology roadmap and validate your assumptions.\nBudget\nWe work with you to establish a responsible budget that incorporates a comprehensive plan. We then build a proposal within the agreed-upon budget.\n“Our Client's Core Business Objective Always Stay At The Heart Of Everything We Do.“\n- Cache Merrill\nFounder & CEO\nStrategy\nBased on budget and schedule requirements, as well as team availability, we build a project plan. It starts with using your core business objectives to outline a high-level plan that achieves your goals and removes as much uncertainty as possible. We define:\nThe nature of the project and its inherent challenges.\nHow we'll deal with those challenges.\nWhich additional actions or are needed to execute the plan.\nProject Ideation\nUnderstanding your business goals is at the core of what we do. Every software development project starts with a central idea—a “problem statement” that drives the conversation. Before moving forward, we make sure we understand all:\nActionable objectives\nDeliverables & Tasks\nPriorities\nResearch\nA good business plan is only worth the results it delivers! If the plan isn’t doable, the work isn’t worth doing, either. Our project team meets with your stakeholders to discuss how to achieve your strategic goals.\nWe define specific functionalities required by users.\nConduct research and consult third-party vendors when necessary.\nThis step should give you a clear vision of the end product, its target audience, and how the initial plan will guide the project.\nDesign & Architecture\nThis is where the end product’s look, feel, and function come into focus on :\nThis is where the end product’s look, feel, and function come into focus.\nReview designs with our engineering team every week.\nDetermine best-fit software development architecture.\nAlready have designs? No problem! We’ll evaluate them for completeness and make sure all the required functionality’s in place. Our in-house design team has you covered!\nPlanning\nOnce core objectives are confirmed, we:\nDefine Key components of delivery\nIdentify internal resources that best fit your process\nIndicate major features and dependencies\nShare requirements with the broader team to make objectives clear.\nWireframes, Prototyping, PoC, and Testing\nOur team includes UX designers who understand the critical importance of creating visually compelling and user-friendly experiences. We work closely with you to:\nLeverage powerful tools and clear processes to build the desired user experience, starting with wireframes and prototypes.\nRun a PoC to validate ideas and mitigate risks before full development.\nIncorporate feedback during PoC and prototyping to make informed decisions before investing in the final application.\nArchitecture\nThere’s no one-size-fits-all solution to software development. Different needs call for individual technologies. Our deep experience with a diverse range of technologies helps us:\nAssess the technology’s long-term viability for a given project.\nDetermine if the best decision is choosing stability and cost over new and unproven.\nAssess the feasibility of using one technology over another.\nA senior tech lead with extensive industry experience guides this stage, shaping the software's functionality and architecture.\nDevelopment\nWith a clear vision for design and functionality, a call is initiated with you, the project manager, and the developers.\nObjectives are restated.\nCommunication methods are confirmed.\nEach engineering team is paired with a senior tech lead and project manager.\nAll Zibtek projects are supervised by the solutions architect, so you’re never without support if an issue arises. Our tech leads have eight to fifteen years of experience and, to ensure quality stays high, are limited to a set number of projects at any given time.\nAgile Development\nTo drive superior results for our clients, the majority of our projects employ a practical agile methodology. In an agile process, the team’s efficiency closely correlates with how much visibility and structure the project manager has.\nCommunications\nQuality, consistent communications throughout a project’s lifecycle ensure your needs and expectations are met.\nBig or small, every team and each member reports daily on their activity.\nProject and delivery managers drive internal and external communication to bridge the divide between technical and non-technical resources\nWith their structured standup, consistent evaluation, peer code reviews, and rapid issue resolution, sprints are a continuous improvement approach that keeps you engaged in every step of the process. You can regularly review the progress of your software development and provide feedback.\n- Share daily written status updates.\n- Track individual engineer tasks.\n- Resolve bugs.\n- Access to shared documents and files.\nSprints\nWe work in sprints which are small, targeted allotments of development time that allow engineers to solve problems more collaboratively. The key benefits offered by sprints’ structured flexibility include:\nMeasured adaptation to change.\nIncorporation of new ideas.\nImprove project predictability.\nBetter control & Superior quality product.\nWith their structured standup, consistent evaluation, peer code reviews, and rapid issue resolution, sprints are a continuous improvement approach that keeps you engaged in every step of the process. You can regularly review the progress of your software development and provide feedback.\nLaunch\nFrom server setup to data storage and deployment, we support your team through launch. And if your software application requires deployment to the app store, we handle that, too!\nDeployment\nPlanning\nWe support your team from setup to launch, automating testing and enabling real-time progress tracking in a client-facing environment for a smooth, high-quality product rollout.\nPlanning\nWhen called for, we:\nAutomate deployments.\nStructure development ecosystems to be scalable.\nThe goal is to automate testing of features to ensure operability once new code is added. Project managers and in-house QA engineers review user stories (informal, general explanations of software features) before the work reaches production.\nDeployment\nDuring the development process we set up multiple environments that allow team members to:\nDeploy quickly.\nShow you everything that’s happening.\nShowing work results in a client-facing development environment helps identify visual and technical issues more quickly, which results in a better product.\nLaunch\nIt’s launch time! We work with you to:\nMitigate launch risks.\nPlan resources around hyper-care and prep infrastructure as appropriate.\nMoving forward, we accept feedback and keep you flexible as your business grows by:\nStructuring new feature rollouts.\nHandling support inquiries.\nTackling new features required by your users.\nContact Us\nReady to transform your business with cloud computing?

From concept to completion, it’s about determining your goals, building a development strategy, and launching a product that meets—but more often than not—exceeds your vision.\nAt Zibtek, we refer to our software development approach as “Practical Agile.” In an agile process, a development team’s efficiency closely correlates with how much visibility and structure the project manager has.\nWhether you’re interested in staff augmentation, a dedicated engineering team, or full-process outsourcing, if you want a simpler and more straightforward approach to software development, now’s the time to take a closer look at the Practical Agile method.\nWhat You'll Learn from the eBook\nHow the Practical Agile method restores the balance of the Agile Manifesto.\nOver the years, we've learned a more balanced approach that values individuals, interactions, processes, and tools. Learn to build software more efficiently and productively with the proper balanced approach.\nHow to deliver projects faster without sacrificing quality.\nIn an agile approach, the focus is on speed, not scope. In practical terms, that means getting the smallest usable features working as quickly as possible. You get the most bang for your investment and a product end-users love.\nHow to have a successful software launch.\nIf it’s to succeed, a Practical Agile process requires good communication, clear requirements, and detailed planning. Without them, there can be a failure to reach a consensus on performance, too many changes in project objectives, inaccurate requirements gathering.\nHow to build the perfect development team.\nWhen building a team, it’s essential to assess the strengths and weaknesses of each member and then assign individuals to teams that reflect a diverse range of personalities and skill-sets. The eBook explains best practice team building processes.\nThe steps to developing a strategic technology roadmap.\nA roadmap defines how new IT tools, processes, and technologies align with your organization’s overall strategy and growth. It provides a clear picture of how your app or software should strategically evolve.\nPut Agile Software Development to Work for You\nZibtek is a leading software development consultancy dedicated to delivering software development solutions that allow our clients to materially accelerate their efforts beyond the capacity and experience of internal teams.\nTo learn more about the Zibtek advantage in software development—and how a practical agile approach can help you take your product across the finish line—download our Ultimate Guide to Agile Software Development today.\nDownload Now\nGet Your eBook Now!\nSubmit\nText a question\nBy continuing to use this site, you agree to our cookie policy and privacy policy.\nGot it"

Brand cohesion in turn drives traffic, conversions and revenue.\nAdobe chose Zibtek as its custom software development company to build and integrate Adobe Experience Manager (AEM). Principal engineering spanned a course five-years, covering front end development, backend development and quality assurance and testing. Adobe acquired Livefyre in 2016 and again chose to lean on Zibtek’s custom software development services to integrate the product into the Adobe Experience Manager and Adobe Marketing Cloud.\nCONTACT ZIBTEK TODAY\nOur Strategy\nHow We Work\nCreate\nOur designers work with you to define every feature, screen, and user flow\nSprint\nDaily status updates and receive product builds every two-week's as we add features\nLearn\nWe analyze user feedback to help you prioritize new features\nProblems\nBuilding the initial solution: Adobe required a proof of concept to be developed followed by a minimum viable product.\nApp Components: The platform needed to have the capability to take in and redeploy a wide variety of data sets. Image files, PDFs, gifs, vector files and dozens of inputs needed to be loaded, then redeployed into corresponding locations. These assets had to flawlessly display the corresponding media with other relevant metadata.\nAEM Asset Integration: Integration spanned both Adobe’s internal systems as well as third party connections.\nThe product needed to quickly embrace any upgrades that came down the Adobe Cloud pipeline and accommodate rapid feature development especially when it comes to different versions of AEM.\nSolution\nAfter an initial development phase was completed, we broke into full scrum and began to execute on the LiveFyre team’s vision for a unified branding suite for businesses of all sizes.\nWe built the app components using Mustache and Less.JS, which runs on NodeJS. Additionally, the software used Mocha and Jasmine, which runs on the Karma test runner, to automate test code coverage.\nIntegrations built by Zibtek’s software development services team permitted users to select user-generated content (UGC) from internal libraries and share them with external media sources. Besides using the UGC library, users gained the ability to fetch relevant assets using various filters from social networking sites like Twitter and Instagram. After collecting the assets, users were then able to insert retrieved assets into various app components as required or push them uniformly across all digital channels. To build the AEM Asset Integration UI, we used Coral, Granite, and JavaScript extensively.\nTesting automation was built and automated using Nightwatch JS, a Selenium instance.\nTo facilitate redundancy, we used numerous development kits to build each unique component. As a largely standalone product, the core functionalities specific to the app are handled or managed within a monolithic codebase.\nPrevious\nNext\nResult\nThe Adobe Livefyre project was a major success for the Adobe brand and now serves a major role in the content landscape for brands around the globe.

The tool helps companies find and prioritize popular and previously submitted ideas from end users on their products and services. By aggregating and weighting client responses, proper merit and direct attention can be more naturally given to the things customers truly care about.\nWith Wantoo, the most valuable ideas for all stakeholders float to the top. Once aggregated, product teams can then sync collected data, gather management input and share reports across communication tools such as Slack, Trello, and Jira.\nThe product’s automatically aggregated and weighted feedback allows companies to capture and prioritize customer needs in a way like never before. The result is better products and engaged customers who participate in product development. Most importantly, companies build up an army of advocates who will extend the company’s reach into their own professional and social networks.\nCONTACT ZIBTEK TODAY\nOur Strategy\nHow We Work\nCreate\nOur designers and architects work with you to define every feature, screen, and user flow.\nSprint\nReceive product builds every two-week's as we add features.\nLearn\nWe analyze user feedback to help you prioritize new features.\nProblems\nThe client identified a gap in the market for product teams that wanted to automatically aggregate customer feedback. The non-technical founder needed a custom software development firm to bring their idea to life.\nThe goal was to create a minimum viable product that could be salable at launch and also be used on itself. The business model chosen was SaaS software development; the client wanted an immediately marketable product.\nInitial market feedback suggested that building a SaaS product was a natural fit because the product had to be adaptable to varying team and customer base sizes and still analyze the feedback given by clients or team members in a dynamic and familiar way for small teams.\nThe tool, as it was conceived, had a built-in feedback loop – when firms used it, data drove the product development roadmap.\nThe platform required direct API integration with Jira, Slack and customer relationship management systems like SalesForce and a wide range of third-party platforms.\nSolution\nWe guided the company through a preliminary discovery phase that included wireframing, design and architecture.\nAs a result of preliminary planning, determinations were made to scale back components of the initial scope to focus on the core aspects of what the business truly needed to launch.\nWe helped Wantoo design and develop the novel concept of ‘Idea Boards’ that help firms get feedback whenever customers interact with a product and company.\nEvery physical data point in the customer journey, digital, or mobile became collectable with just a single line of code.\nIntegrated with Zendesk, Salesforce, Twitter, and Facebook APIs among other social platforms, the tool could be implemented by enterprise firms from day one.\nPrevious\nNext\n4+\nCountries\n500+\nHappy Clients\n1000+\nProjects\n200+\nDomain Experts\nReady to start your project?\nContact\nText a question\nBy continuing to use this site, you agree to our cookie policy and privacy policy.\nGot it"

Scalability, speed and other performance problems began to suffer as the system gained greater adoption. Statix needed a custom software development to take the original vision and functionality of the core application built in WordPress and convert it to a scalable application that could handle significantly more usage volume.\nAs the software houses sensitive patient data, the client needed healthcare and software development services, largely focused on HIPAA compliance. The client wanted to allow the solution to be scalable and accommodate the growth of the business. Additional functionality was also added to further enhance security, compliance and the delivery of patient data. They also wanted to enhance the functionalities of the custom web application to streamline their business processes, delivering high-className performance to their customers.\nProblems with the application:\nIn application, around 40% of the functionalities were done manually by the client, including:\nManually updated attempt logs: Site coordinators (people who manage the surveys being conducted) had to manually update records in the database about the attempted calls made to study participants. For instance, if site coordinators or interviewers call a patient to take feedback or ask certain questions for surveys, and the patient didn’t answer the call or his/her phone number was incorrect, then the site coordinators had to enter these records (‘call not answered’ or ‘wrong number’) manually in the database.\nManually scheduled surveys for patients: Site coordinators had to manually schedule or prioritize the surveys (consisting of a set of questions) for their patients for a certain date or time.\nNo proper randomization for clinical trials: There was no proper randomization process on the website. Site coordinators wanted a reliable method to eliminate all the sources of bias in the treatment assignments, ensuring equality among the patients in terms of receiving treatments and data recorded.\nThe backend functionalities of the web application were written in PHP and largely outdated. To compound the problem, the website used WordPress as its Content Management System (CMS), which caused various issues for the client such as improper data handling, problems with refreshing pages, data storage issues, etc.\nIn order to enhance and improve their web application, they wanted to migrate from the old technologies-- PHP and WordPress to some of the latest technologies available.In order to enhance and improve their web application, they wanted to migrate from the old technologies-- PHP and WordPress to some of the latest technologies available.\nThe website did not have a proper authentication process. The client needed to keep their network secure by only permitting verified users to access protected resources.\nThe client needed a Business Intelligence (BI) tool on the website in order to see the business progress and survey responses of the patients in the form of charts. They also needed a BI tool that was within their budget.\nSolution\nThis project was resolved by domain-specific experts and engineers. Our specialists were able to deliver high-quality service that exactly met the unique business needs to build the custom healthcare application.\nThe solutions we provided to address the problems:\nWe automated all the work that was previously done manually in the application. Some primary issues resolved included:\nAutomated updating of attempt logs in the database using Angular:Using Bootstrap and Angular, we automated the task of updating attempt logs in the database. We created a list, ‘Attempt type’ on the website that contained various options (including ‘No answer’, ‘Email sent’, ‘Phone busy’, and more). Unlike before, site coordinators no longer need to enter the patient's ‘attempt logs’ record manually in the database. Users simply needed to pick any option from the ‘attempt type’ list, and the record will automatically get updated in the database.\nAutomated scheduling of surveys using Angular:Using Angular, we automated the scheduling of surveys on the website. We provided a list of options, from which the site coordinators or interviewers from the client side can select any date or time they want to take surveys. The surveys will automatically trigger on the web application at the selected time and date.\nProvided a proper randomization process using MEAN stack (Full-stack JavaScript, including MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, and Node.js): Using MEAN stack, we provided a proper randomization process (the most reliable method for clinical trials) available on web application. The structure doesn’t allow hospitals or doctors to manipulate the results; removes bias, providing a real representation to the patients regarding the treatment or drugs used.\nUsing MEAN stack, we improved and enhanced all the backend functionalities of the software application that were outdated. We reduced load time for all web pages and resolved all the issues related to data storage and data handling. Also, we modernized the interfaces for the entire front-end leveraging modularized loading capabilities.\nUsing the Twilio REST API, our developers coded the app to provide a two-factor authentication (2FA) process and resolve security concerns.\nWe embedded a Business Intelligence (BI) tool--MongoDB Charts. This reporting tool represents data in the form of dynamically created charts. With MongoDB Charts, the client was able to derive key insights, such as how a given study is progressing, how the users are responding to the application, and how the survey responses from patients were progressing, etc.\nAfter significant research, our experts presented Microsoft Power BI and MongoDB Charts as a budget-friendly option.\nDevelopers used a cloud service-- MongoDB Atlas\nNode.js APIs were connected to MongoDB Atlas from the application\nThey also added additional security features, including:\nAdmins, super admin on the client, were created and authorized to access the database or dashboard of the website in order to create charts programmatically.\nAdmin and super admins on the client site can grant access to the database and grant view permissions to end users..\nPrevious\nNext\nResult\nReliance on the heavily modified wordpress CMS was ended with the launch of the new, custom software application. Following the successful web application launch, the client has begun further development of a mobile application project in order to further enhance the product offering.\nBusiness outcomes that we delivered for this project:\nApplication data retrieval and loading times were reduced by 90%, improving the overall application performance.\nThe application became scalable with increased hardware availability.\n40% increased in automation, as manual work has been eliminated.\nWith the introduction of new technology and services, we delivered an error-free and superior quality application to our client using a cost-effective approach.\nUsing modern technologies, our developers added additional functionality above the previous web application, enabling it to meet the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) policy standards.\n4+\nCountries\n500+\nHappy Clients\n1000+\nProjects\n200+\nDomain Experts\nReady to start your project?\nContact\nText a question\nBy continuing to use this site, you agree to our cookie policy and privacy policy.\nGot it"

When a patient is receiving expensive cosmetic or dental work it is a real possibility that life events or accidents after the fact could lead to expensive rework. Patients at dental practices who use Dental Warranty gain the ability to ensure their investment is protected. Dental practices benefit from incremental revenue and patients save money; both parties reduce risk.\nWhen a dental patient receives cosmetic, restorative, fixed or removable dental treatment, many of these dental treatments are not covered under a patient’s insurance policy. In some cases it could be prohibitively expensive for a patient to pay the huge dental bills for any rework.\nAs a result of using the service, treatments are backed by a world-className warranty policy and transferable to other dentists using the service. The outcome is peace-of-mind and savings for dentists as well as patients.\nCONTACT ZIBTEK TODAY\nOur Strategy\nHow We Work\nCreate\nOur designers and architects work with you to define every feature, screen, and user flow\nSprint\nReceive product builds every two-week's as we add features\nLearn\nReceive product builds every two-week's as we add features\nProblems\nOver the years, the application architecture had been modified several times and included older versions of available technologies.

To maintain productivity and growth for the firm, the company needed to evaluate structural issues with the codebase.\nThe application was also lagging behind in needed updates and enhancements which would materially facilitate long term objectives in the business model. It needed improvements in front-end and back-end functionalities.\nThe client was facing issues maintaining the database for their customers’ warranty and insurance accounts. And, in some instances page loading time on the web application was significant, leading to slow performance.\nA robust account set up was needed on the web application in order to display the proper information to the customers who signed up for the product.\nFinally, as numerous practices were using the software, ongoing support requests had to be accomplished in addition to other tasks. The application was not properly optimized to resolve routine support issues and unique customer concerns often required direct database level updates.\nSolution\nAs the system used an older version of Angular, our team had to focus on cleaning up components which could be resolved with a degree of finality. Angular components which could be updated were improved and enhanced ensuring data was being properly saved in the back-end. Numerous functions were re-written along with enhancements to the user interface for the web application. Particular issues resolved in the Angular front end include:\nCreated uniform dialogue popups – we made a dynamic className structure to ensure that the correct pop-ups messages were getting properly displayed for every customer (dental office) who accessed the website to register coverage for their patients.\nEliminate data redundancy issues – in our audit, our developers discovered that the app was coded in a way that made use of numerous redundant classNamees. Significant measures were taken to eliminate problematic, redundant data issues between the .Net and Angular application layers.\nSpeed and performance optimization - we were able to improve web application performance and optimize numerous queries for speed. Proper segregation of data reduced page loading time and improved available bandwidth on the server, making the app run significantly faster for end users.\nUsing proper REST API structures, we fixed the following back-end issues on the web application:\nWe corrected the pending registration list to properly display data, whereas before, even if the number of registrations exceeds the previous maximum, it would display.\nAccount set up issues were resolved to allow the display of the relevant information, including a list of warranties, coverage, and insurance, when customers or users signed up on the product.\nPrevious\nNext\nResult\nThrough dedication to the project, we delivered the following business outcomes:\nTask turnaround time improved by 70% over previously observed periods. Refactored API code storage and the entire deployment processes, reduced deployments from several hours to under an hour.\nA robust database alert system was added to notify internal teams and management to server issues.\nStability was materially enhanced for the company and end users.\nAfter the application was properly optimized, the client was able to deliver enhanced value to their customers and return their focus to new features.\n4+\nCountries\n500+\nHappy Clients\n1000+\nProjects\n200+\nDomain Experts\nReady to start your project?\nContact\nText a question\nBy continuing to use this site, you agree to our cookie policy and privacy policy.\nGot it"

With increased user volume, the firm also needed staff augmentation services to support growing support and QA needs. The firm wanted to update all four web application views, Fortify, Turn, Lift and RecoverySuite. With business growth, their solutions were becoming more complex and the growing codebase required more hands to maintain. They also needed legacy code to be refactored and made into a scalable solution that would serve the growing business needs of their clients.\nProblems faced by the client:\nThe custom web application required material refactoring of core components. Numerous legacy code conflicts were causing the hardware to peg the server resulting in frequent database freezes.\nApart from improvements to server side rendering performance, the application required numerous updates and additions to existing functionality to meet their unique business needs. Enterprise clients wanted enhancements to core survey sections and to implement new features and functionality to enable broader reach to a wide variety of audiences.\nAverage page loading time within the web application was 40 seconds on an ideal network connection. Materially reducing load time, softened jarring for the user, meant that the delivery of data to the front end had to be updated asynchronously. The obvious result of better load time would be delivery of a better user experience to their customers.\nSolution\nOur team executed a comprehensive code audit in parallel with the current development team. The objective was twofold – we wanted to evaluate the defects within the system and the inefficiencies in the software development process. The desired outcome was to materially enhance the performance of Fortify, Turn, Lift and Recovery Suite, improve the consumer experience and allow the application to truly scale. Of note, the interest of enterprise clients also required additional security and testing measures to be put in place to enhance data integrity.\nCritical paths executed for improvement and enhancement of the applications:\nOperating within the existing Ruby on Rails and SQL environments, our developers worked to eradicate all issues causing hardware lockups and database freezing. This resolved immediate issues.\nNew features and functionalities were added in the survey section of the web app. These enhancements and modifications simplified the process of conducting online surveys while increasing the user interactivity in the application, increasing on-page engagement.\nSolutions had to be provided without disrupting active users in any material way. Our developers navigated these issues by deploying at low system utilization times and in the evenings. Front-end enhancements led to the improvement of APIs as they often presented low hanging fruit opportunities for code repair.\nPrevious\nNext\nResult\nZibtek’s custom software development services team was able to deliver material enhancements to the client in relatively short order. Improvements applied to all four web applications: Fortify, Turn, Lift and Recovery Suite and extended to their mobile applications as well. Operating to resolve critical path items resulted in the following business outcomes:\nAverage page loading times reduced from 40 seconds to 3 seconds.\nStreamlined and enhanced database functionality improving service effectiveness and reducing downtime.\nAn almost 80% reduction in effort required to troubleshoot bugs from taking real-time feedback and conducting surveys, improving the overall business value.\nCustomer satisfaction is enhanced by 50%.\nIncreased application use, growing to over 155 countries\nFollowing the client’s complete satisfaction with our work, they outsourced the creation of a mobile application to us in order to develop a new mobile application from scratch.\n4+\nCountries\n500+\nHappy Clients\n1000+\nProjects\n200+\nDomain Experts\nReady to start your project?\nContact\nText a question\nBy continuing to use this site, you agree to our cookie policy and privacy policy.\nGot it"

Training Amigo engaged Zibtek as their software development company of choice to build their MVP platform and support it long term with staff augmentation services.\nFor the initial MVP development of the product, the company wanted to build a solution to facilitate virtual fitness challenges across the globe. Users also needed the option to redeem the points that they earn to get discounts and prizes.\nWith a layer of gamification they wanted to allow users to earn wellness points by syncing their fitness devices with Health Kit. Surpassing milestones allowed users to unlock new discounts and prizes. Social features in Training Amigo let users motivate other ‘amigos’ across the globe. One of the unique features of the app is the ability to locate local health professionals and coaches across the globe.\nCONTACT ZIBTEK TODAY\nOur Strategy\nHow We Work\nCreate\nOur designers work with you to define every feature, screen, and user flow\nSprint\nReceive product builds every two-week's as we add features\nLearn\nWe analyze user feedback to help you prioritize new features\nProblems\nThe client was a non-technical founder who needed a custom software development team to bring his vision for a digital wellness platform to life.\nAs the company was a self-funded startup, the founder needed an engineering team to guide application development towards core platform development and a functional MVP before any ancillary features were completed.\nThe goal was to raise capital once value could be proven. Zibtek helped develop the initial product roadmap before jumping into development.\nOne primary objective of the application was to collect data on a user’s daily activity including but not limited to steps, distance, and calories.\nThe client wanted us to pull in the activities data from third-party devices such as iOS Health Kit and provide actionable insights using that data. This required significant custom IOT and wearable custom development.\nData from various devices needed to be transformed into a unified format and required cross compatibility of data from different devices such as Fitbit, Jawbone, Health App, Withings, Apple Watch, and more.\nSolutions\nZibtek helped the client define scope for the MVP version of the product as well as the product roadmap.\nZibtek’s engineers built a simple cloud based web application that rounded out the core MVP features desired by the client and their target market.\nEngineers then build a single data collection module to integrate directly with various third-party applications such as Fitbit, Jawbone and Withings using oAuth. We also integrated Apple Health Kit APIs to fetch data from iOS health apps. In some cases, devices pushed data to central servers used by those external firms and was then retrieved via API.\nThe features of the final version of the product include health screenings, preventive health care education, engagement features like connecting with other users and participating in wellness contests.\nPrevious\nNext\nResult\nAs a startup firm, the company needed their proof of concept to wow investors and showcase real results from the MVP.\nBased on our work, Training Amigo successfully completed four rounds of funding.\nAs a result of development efforts and the capital raise, the firm has been able to flourish as an independent firm.\nThe company continues to grow organically and maintain continued use from its customers across the US.\n4+\nCountries\n500+\nHappy Clients\n1000+\nProjects\n200+\nDomain Experts\nReady to start your project?\nContact\nText a question\nBy continuing to use this site, you agree to our cookie policy and privacy policy.\nGot it"

The web presence serves as both an online marketplace, e-commerce store and web application with built in test questions and education tools.\nThe objective of the programs, services and products are to provide parents an arsenal of tools that help parents in their quest to prepare their children for testing and entry to kindergarten and beyond.\nTThrough structured tools that facilitate challenges, practice, repetition and behavioral characteristics like listening, focus and perseverance the service aims to help improve cognition and performance. TestingMom.com is accredited by the National Council for Private School Accreditation and by Accreditation International.\nTesting Mom’s online curriculum is proven to achieve desired results. The web application’s online learning tools have a database of over 100,000 questions aimed at helping children better prepare for exams. Testing Mom also has an array of resources in the form of printable practice sheets and interactive games that students can download and work on.\nZibtek was engaged to provide custom mobile application development services and help the firm expand into new verticals.\nCONTACT ZIBTEK TODAY\nOur Strategy\nHow We Work\nCreate\nOur designers and architects work with you to define every feature, screen, and user flow\nSprint\nReceive product builds every two-week's as we add features\nLearn\nWe analyze user feedback to help you prioritize new features\nProblems\nThe client’s existing web platform had an established presence but lacked platform diversity. Within the web application, Testing Mom already had online games in place, but they were interested in venturing into the mobile app space (iOS).\nWith increased mobile device use, the company needed to become multiplatform.\nSpecifically the firm wanted to explore mobile games and had an idea of how they wanted the game to look. Focused on education, the firm did not have an in-house developer or designer who could assist them in bringing their idea to reality. The company needed a custom and mobile application development company to build a native mobile solution.\nAn additional objective of the game was a kid-friendly user experience and interface that would appeal to kids, while still remaining educational.\nThe client was also on a tight timeframe with the start of the new school year.\nSolution\nZibtek was engaged to provide custom iOS development services as well as custom android development services.\nDesign and user interfaces were first created and approved for the mobile device format. While a hybrid application was stipulated, small proof of concept efforts were undertaken to confirm performance.\nUltimately, we didn’t opt for a hybrid solution as performance and fluid movement from screen to screen was a high priority for the client. The performance derived from native applications for game development outperformed what was available from other solutions.\nTo facilitate the highest performance and quality, two native platform apps were written using Swift for iOS and the latest long term release of the Java mobile SDK.\nPreview builds were generated and shared among a small group of beta testers within the organization. Prior to launching into the mobile market, the company wanted to confirm that the assessments put forward in the mobile application format conformed to the quality standards that matched the other online formats they provided.\nPrevious\nNext\nResult\nThe platform was able to extend its offering for children’s education into the mobile arena in the form of games and quizzes for native devices.\nZibtek launched the web and mobile applications into the respective App and Play stores.\nTesting Mom has emerged as one of the dominant players in online education space for kindergarten students.\n4+\nCountries\n500+\nHappy Clients\n1000+\nProjects\n200+\nDomain Experts\nReady to start your project?\nContact\nText a question\nBy continuing to use this site, you agree to our cookie policy and privacy policy.\nGot it"

The Giving Keys needed to hire a web development company to help take their idea from a vision to a fully-fledged working e-commerce website.\nThe company wanted to pursue an e-commerce distribution and sales model to support its business model. But, as founders were non-technical they required the assistance of an e-commerce development firm to build their online store. As marketing efforts had a national reach, the best mechanism for supporting the business model was an intuitive shopping interface that could also be maintained by internal staff after it was established.\nAs a young firm they needed a custom e-commerce development team to assist them in selecting an appropriate platform for the development of their store among the widely used tools including:\nBig Commerce development was evaluated against other platforms and included a proof of concept text to understand the ease of use for the company once setup\nMagento development was considered as a an open-source alternative to the paid platforms.

A plethora of Node.js libraries and applications are published on npm, and many more are added every day. These applications can be searched for on http://search.npmjs.org/. Once you have a package you want to install, it can be installed with a single-line command.\nOur Strategy\nHow we work\nCreate\nOur designers work with you to define every feature, screen, and user flow\nSprint\nReceive product builds every two-week's as we add features\nLearn\nWe analyze user feedback to help you prioritize new features\nProblems\nThe system needs to support several different authentication methods.\nIt should be a platform that makes sharing of private modules easy within the teams.\nCompanies and the team using the web application tool need to have better control of the development and deployment of the workflow.\nCode discovery should be simple, and easy. The process of sharing it across the customer's organization should not be complicated but should be easy.\nSolution\nWe used Docker, Replicated, npmE appliance and the npmE installer bin for npmE. Docker is used primarily to run Replicated and npmE appliance. Replicated is the orchestration software and admin console for npmE. It includes its own Docker images and containers, easily integrating with the underlying operating system.\nNodeJS is used to write npmE. To use it, the user needs to install node and npm installed on to the host.\nPrevious\nNext\n4+\nCountries\n500+\nHappy Clients\n1000+\nProjects\n200+\nDomain Experts\nReady to start your project?\nContact\nText a question\nBy continuing to use this site, you agree to our cookie policy and privacy policy.\nGot it"
