    "extractedText": "+1 (385) 832 6227\nContact\nPractical Agile Development Services\nOur Software Development Process\nRequest Information\nSelect Inquiry Type\nSubmit now\nOur Software Development Process\nWhat is a practical agile approach to software development? At Zibtek , it's a combination of:\nHigh-Trust, Self-Organized Teams Who Understand Specific Business Needs.\nPrinciples And Practices That Can Easily Be Combined With A Variety Of Approaches.\nStaying Focused On The Rapid Development And Deployment Of Software.\nAt Zibtek, good software development starts with a great idea. From concept to solution, we work with you to plan, develop, test, deliver, and assess your software needs. Our practical approach transforms the agile process from a mystifying undertaking to one where transparency and communication keep our clients happy!\nPre-Project Consultation\nPreventing failure during the software development process begins with avoiding failure in the planning stage. Each project starts with a solid strategy used to build out a complete proposal and becomes the launch point for development. To determine your goals and objectives, we consult with you to better understand what you do and what you want to accomplish.\nAssess Fit\nAre we the right cultural fit for each other? Can we deliver the product you want and deserve?\nRefine Idea\nWe ask questions—lots of questions! We want to fully understand your technology roadmap and validate your assumptions.\nBudget\nWe work with you to establish a responsible budget that incorporates a comprehensive plan. We then build a proposal within the agreed-upon budget.\n“Our Client's Core Business Objective Always Stay At The Heart Of Everything We Do.“\n- Cache Merrill\nFounder & CEO\nStrategy\nBased on budget and schedule requirements, as well as team availability, we build a project plan. It starts with using your core business objectives to outline a high-level plan that achieves your goals and removes as much uncertainty as possible. We define:\nThe nature of the project and its inherent challenges.\nHow we'll deal with those challenges.\nWhich additional actions or are needed to execute the plan.\nProject Ideation\nUnderstanding your business goals is at the core of what we do. Every software development project starts with a central idea—a “problem statement” that drives the conversation. Before moving forward, we make sure we understand all:\nActionable objectives\nDeliverables & Tasks\nPriorities\nResearch\nA good business plan is only worth the results it delivers! If the plan isn’t doable, the work isn’t worth doing, either. Our project team meets with your stakeholders to discuss how to achieve your strategic goals.\nWe define specific functionalities required by users.\nConduct research and consult third-party vendors when necessary.\nThis step should give you a clear vision of the end product, its target audience, and how the initial plan will guide the project.\nDesign & Architecture\nThis is where the end product’s look, feel, and function come into focus on :\nThis is where the end product’s look, feel, and function come into focus.\nReview designs with our engineering team every week.\nDetermine best-fit software development architecture.\nAlready have designs? No problem! We’ll evaluate them for completeness and make sure all the required functionality’s in place. Our in-house design team has you covered!\nPlanning\nOnce core objectives are confirmed, we:\nDefine Key components of delivery\nIdentify internal resources that best fit your process\nIndicate major features and dependencies\nShare requirements with the broader team to make objectives clear.\nWireframes, Prototyping, PoC, and Testing\nOur team includes UX designers who understand the critical importance of creating visually compelling and user-friendly experiences. We work closely with you to:\nLeverage powerful tools and clear processes to build the desired user experience, starting with wireframes and prototypes.\nRun a PoC to validate ideas and mitigate risks before full development.\nIncorporate feedback during PoC and prototyping to make informed decisions before investing in the final application.\nArchitecture\nThere’s no one-size-fits-all solution to software development. Different needs call for individual technologies. Our deep experience with a diverse range of technologies helps us:\nAssess the technology’s long-term viability for a given project.\nDetermine if the best decision is choosing stability and cost over new and unproven.\nAssess the feasibility of using one technology over another.\nA senior tech lead with extensive industry experience guides this stage, shaping the software's functionality and architecture.\nDevelopment\nWith a clear vision for design and functionality, a call is initiated with you, the project manager, and the developers.\nObjectives are restated.\nCommunication methods are confirmed.\nEach engineering team is paired with a senior tech lead and project manager.\nAll Zibtek projects are supervised by the solutions architect, so you’re never without support if an issue arises. Our tech leads have eight to fifteen years of experience and, to ensure quality stays high, are limited to a set number of projects at any given time.\nAgile Development\nTo drive superior results for our clients, the majority of our projects employ a practical agile methodology. In an agile process, the team’s efficiency closely correlates with how much visibility and structure the project manager has.\nCommunications\nQuality, consistent communications throughout a project’s lifecycle ensure your needs and expectations are met.\nBig or small, every team and each member reports daily on their activity.\nProject and delivery managers drive internal and external communication to bridge the divide between technical and non-technical resources\nWith their structured standup, consistent evaluation, peer code reviews, and rapid issue resolution, sprints are a continuous improvement approach that keeps you engaged in every step of the process. You can regularly review the progress of your software development and provide feedback.\n- Share daily written status updates.\n- Track individual engineer tasks.\n- Resolve bugs.\n- Access to shared documents and files.\nSprints\nWe work in sprints which are small, targeted allotments of development time that allow engineers to solve problems more collaboratively. The key benefits offered by sprints’ structured flexibility include:\nMeasured adaptation to change.\nIncorporation of new ideas.\nImprove project predictability.\nBetter control & Superior quality product.\nWith their structured standup, consistent evaluation, peer code reviews, and rapid issue resolution, sprints are a continuous improvement approach that keeps you engaged in every step of the process. You can regularly review the progress of your software development and provide feedback.\nLaunch\nFrom server setup to data storage and deployment, we support your team through launch. And if your software application requires deployment to the app store, we handle that, too!\nDeployment\nPlanning\nWe support your team from setup to launch, automating testing and enabling real-time progress tracking in a client-facing environment for a smooth, high-quality product rollout.\nPlanning\nWhen called for, we:\nAutomate deployments.\nStructure development ecosystems to be scalable.\nThe goal is to automate testing of features to ensure operability once new code is added. Project managers and in-house QA engineers review user stories (informal, general explanations of software features) before the work reaches production.\nDeployment\nDuring the development process we set up multiple environments that allow team members to:\nDeploy quickly.\nShow you everything that’s happening.\nShowing work results in a client-facing development environment helps identify visual and technical issues more quickly, which results in a better product.\nLaunch\nIt’s launch time! We work with you to:\nMitigate launch risks.\nPlan resources around hyper-care and prep infrastructure as appropriate.\nMoving forward, we accept feedback and keep you flexible as your business grows by:\nStructuring new feature rollouts.\nHandling support inquiries.\nTackling new features required by your users.\nContact Us\nReady to transform your business with cloud computing?

    "extractedText": "What is System UI?\nIan J.H Reynolds\nExplore Ian J.H Reynolds' expertise in finance and economics through his insightful articles on market trends, investment strategies, and economic analysis.\nMore posts by Ian J.H Reynolds.\nIAN J.H REYNOLDS\n6 JUL 2020 • 8 MIN READ\nThe mobile landscape looked a lot different just a decade ago. There were multiple platforms and operating systems all competing for a piece of the pie. However, the industry has gone through incredible consolidation in the past few years.\nOne of the reasons why Android has become so popular is because it allows for an incredibly high level of customization. Most mobile platforms didn't allow customization beyond wallpapers or themes but with Android, it's possible to change the entire look and feel of the user interface (UI).\nWhat is System UI?\nGoing by its textbook definition, System UI is any element that's displayed on the screen that's not part of an app. This means that it’s possible to significantly customize this interface without the need for an app update. It exists independent of apps on the device, yet Google doesn’t make it easy to access this tool.\nFor app developers, System UI is the framework on top of which they build their app. It's a way for Google to ensure that apps are compliant with the overall visual experience that it wants Android users to have. With system UI, apps can adhere to the Home screen, notifications, and global device navigation experience as envisaged by Google.\nSystem UI and Android\nThe System UI Tuner was first spotted when the Android Marshmallow preview was launched back in 2015. It existed as a customization menu in the Settings app. It basically provided a preview of the customization features that Google was working on.\nIt stuck around as an accessible menu in the Settings app for a while but when the third preview of Marshmallow was released, Google made the System UI Tuner a hidden menu.\nThe System UI Tuner enabled users to perform many different tweaks to the user interface of their device. They could hide status bars, for example, or show battery percentage.\nIt can be accessed on a device by pulling down the notification shade and holding down a tap on the gear icon for about five seconds. A message will then appear confirming that System UI Tuner has been added to the Settings app. The process may be slightly different on devices that use skinned versions of Android.\nGoogle allows app developers to control the system UI visibility. For example, if you build a video player, you might want the navigation and status bars to hide automatically when a user enters fullscreen mode. The system UI framework makes it possible for the app to do just that.\nWhat can you use it for?\nTypically System UI will display the system bars, which consist of the status and navigation bars, concurrently with an app. However, it does allow apps that display immersive content to temporarily dim the bar icons or hide the bars altogether for a more immersive experience.\nGoogle advises developers that their apps should adhere to the standard Android UI guidelines and usage patterns. It cautions then to carefully consider the users' needs and expectations before making modifications to the system bars as they're meant to provide a standard way of navigation the device and viewing its status.\nHow to use System UI\nThere are a few different ways that you can use the System UI Tuner to enhance your custom applications. For example, it's possible to dim the status and navigation bars with the SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LOW_PROFILE flag.\nThis approach is advantageous because the bars will remain present but have their details obscured, this allows the app to create an immersive experience without taking away easy access to the bars.\nTo create an immersive full screen app so that users can engage more deeply with content, there are three different options that can be used in System UI to make an app go fullscreen. The SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_HIDE_NAVIGATION flag can be used to hide the navigation bar in an app.\nIt's even possible to modify the Android source code to customize the System UI on a much deeper scale, however, if this is done it makes it very difficult to apply future Android updates.\nTo mitigate this problem, Android has support for the use of an overlay directly, which allows developers to replace resource files without having to modify the source code. This overlay system overrides files in a controlled manner inside the Android build system, allowing for the modified files to be identified clearly without having to traverse the entire tree of the source code.\nImplementing the System UI Tuner in your custom app\nAn app's styling is what makes it distinguishable from others. People who download your app will get their first impression of it based solely on the look and feel of the application. If it's not intuitive enough or it just looks plain bad, there's a high chance that they'll delete the app and never download it again.\nThere are quite a few benefits of implementing this in your custom app. First and foremost, it enables the app to provide a truly immersive experience to users. It also looks for a more intuitive user interface, which is something that most users want when they start using an app.\nIt’s important that all of the System UI integrations are properly done when an app is being developed. This will ensure that no bugs surface when the app is rolled out to users. Therefore, it’s vital to have people work on this part of the project that are highly skilled in System UI integrations.\nYou realize now that it’s probably for the better if you get professional help when it comes to System UI customization for your custom app. It’s only going to be for the better. Think about it. You spend an incredible amount of time and resources in coming up with an idea for an app. Then you invest more into actually getting it developed.\nWouldn’t you want everything to be done right the first time? Not only is that going to save you from headaches and additional costs in the long run, it’s also going to reduce the risk of a bad user experience.\nYou wouldn’t want your app to develop a bad reputation right out of the gate, so much so that even subsequent updates don’t convince users enough to give it a second chance.\nGet professional help with your System UI customization\nFor this very reason, you should work with professionals who are highly skilled in System UI integrations for Android apps. The developers at Zibtek are very well accustomed to integrating System UI in apps and they’ll be able to get the job done right for you.\nIf you haven’t heard of Zibtek, you’ll be surprised to learn that it’s one of the leading software development companies in the world. It has worked with a wide range of companies, helping both Fortune 500 conglomerates to startup companies alike to transform their vision into reality.\nThrough its custom software solutions, Zibtek has empowered companies to achieve greater profitability and efficiency, increase their valuations, and become more successful by utilizing the right tools.\nZibtek is based in the United States with offices in Salt Lake City. It also has a global team of developers that’s managed from within the United States. It has highly skilled mobile app developers on its team that practically speak Android development like a first language. They put the same level of effort into everything that they do and have developed hundreds of successful to date.\nThe company provides end-to-end mobile app development services for the Android platform as well as all other platforms. Its developers can handle the entire project lifecycle so even if you just provide them with the concept, they will be able to create a polished product.\nThe developers have a deep understanding of the mobile app development environments, SDKs and APIs in addition to all methodologies.\nOne of the main goals of the development team at Zibtek is to ensure that your app has a navigation methodology which doesn't require users to develop a deep understanding first.\nIt should be intuitive, moving through the app should come as second nature to your users. The mobile design is thus centered around form, function, suitable content in addition to a nimble user interface.\nZibtek has developed a wide range of applications, including but not limited to mobile games and apps for learning. All of the work is done to the highest engineering standards in the business, this includes the proper understanding of the MVC framework to bulletproof deployment standards.\nInterested? Reach out to the team at Zibtek for a consultation today and they’ll be happy to work with you so that you can have the peace of mind that the System UI integration you need for your app has been done just the way it’s supposed to be.\nWhy is UI important?\nUser interface is essential to meeting user expectations and supporting your site’s functionality. Well-executed UI facilitates efficient interaction between the user and the app, program, or machine via clean design, contrasting visuals, and responsiveness.\nWhat are some examples of System UI?\nEvery feature you see on Android which isn’t an app is System UI. Components particular to System UI include:\nLockscreen UI, which authenticates users to a specific user account.\nThe navigation bar.\nKeyboard\nThe status bar that contains connectivity icons, pull-down notification panels, and heads-up notifications.\nVolume UI or the dialog displayed when a user utilizes physical volume buttons.\nWhat are the benefits of implementing the system UI tuner?\nWhen someone downloads an app, opens it, and doesn’t like the way it looks, feels, or responds, they’ll quickly delete it and never download it again. To ensure a good user experience, developers implement the System UI Tuner to improve custom applications.\nWhat’s the difference between a UI developer and a UX developer?\nThough the terms are related and can overlap, they are not interchangeable. There are three main differences between UI and UX developers.\n(1) While UI deals with look and feel, UX deals with end-user interaction quality.\n(2) UI design has an artistic component that UX does not.\n(3) UI is more of a technical component for producing design features for the finished product while UX focuses on the user’s experience of navigating the app. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

    "extractedText": "Django vs Flask\nIan J.H Reynolds\nExplore Ian J.H Reynolds' expertise in finance and economics through his insightful articles on market trends, investment strategies, and economic analysis.\nMore posts by Ian J.H Reynolds.\nIAN J.H REYNOLDS\n6 AUG 2020 • 6 MIN READ\nWhen considering which web framework to use for their next project, web developers often compare Django vs Flask. Web services, APIs and resources can only be built upon a solid foundation. Developers thus rely on a web framework which can best be described as a software structure which supports the development of these web applications. They provide developers with a standard way to develop and deploy these apps on the internet.\nDevelopers often have to perform a lot of common activities in web development. They are repetitive tasks that can take up time and thus delay the project. Web frameworks make it easier to automate these repetitive tasks by providing libraries for things like database access and session management. They can also often allow code reuse.\nDjango and Flask happen to be the two most widely used Python web frameworks. Both have mature developer communities with widespread support. They have their strengths and weaknesses but ultimately, they're both used to develop web applications.\nDjango vs Flask - What is Django?\nDjango is an open-source Python-based web framework that allows for easy creation of database-driven websites. Django operates on a \"batteries included\" approach whereby components for patterns, tools, features, functionality and more are provided out of the box. This helps save time for developers.\nFor example, most web apps require authentication and authorization, in order to ascertain who the user is and what they're allowed to do. Django has support for both with an account management solution out of the box. A functional admin panel is also available for Django. It's a web application that provides a user interface so that it's easier to manage data based on the developers' models.\nAdvantages\nIt’s Written In Python\nPython is one of the most popular programming languages because it's clean and easy to learn. The fact that Django is written in Python is a major advantage for this web framework. The programming language is simple to work with, particularly for newbies, which makes the web framework accessible to developers of all skill levels.\nBuilt for speed\nDjango is the web framework of choice for developers on a deadline. The framework's design is entirely focused on reducing development time. Django provides developers with features that allow them to build custom web applications quickly.\nMVC programming paradigm is supported\nDjango has support for the model-view-controller (MVC) design rule. This programming paradigm enables developers to keep their web app's user interface and business logic layers completely separate. This enables them to quickly scale up web apps while also allowing them to reuse the same business logic for multiple projects.\nStrong security features are built-in\nThe security of web apps is of paramount importance and this framework acknowledges that. To that end, Django has integrated security features that protect web apps from targeted attacks launched through methods like SQL injection, cross-site scripting and cross-site request forgery.\nDisadvantages\nNot suited for small web apps\nDjango doesn't really prove to be useful for simple and small web apps. Its impressive suite of features is very useful for developers that want to build large and complex web apps but that functionality is normally not required for simpler apps. This additional functionality could thus end up affecting the performance of small web apps which means developers have to actively find ways to improve the performance of their simple apps if they're built on Django.\nUses Regex to specify URL\nDjango uses Regex or regular expressions to specify its URLs. These URL routing patterns make the code larger with more complicated syntaxes. It can be difficult to accomplish particularly for developers who are not highly skilled and it can also feel bloated for small projects.\nTemplate errors fail silently\nOne shortcoming that Django has is that its template errors fail silently. This means that developers don't immediately know what's wrong and they can spend a lot of time trying to figure out exactly what went wrong. There may even be cases where they don't even know there's a problem with their application.\nOver-reliance on ORM system\nDjango's ORM system allows developers to work with multiple databases and this speeds up common database operations. However, its ORM system doesn't have many useful features that other ORM systems provide, so developers can't take full advantage of the Python SQL toolkit.\nDjango vs Flask - What is Flask?\nFlask is a microframework and as such, it's better suited to single-page, small and medium-sized web applications. It doesn't have any data models of its own as Flask takes a more modular approach towards development. No ORM is provided and Flask only gives developers a basic set of tools that they can use for web development.\nMany developers prefer Flask because of the flexibility that it offers. Since it's a minimalistic framework that places no restrictions, developers can rely on external libraries to achieve the intended result.\nAdvantages\nFacilitates experimentation\nDevelopers that are working on a project with unique needs should opt for Flask. All Flask projects have their own internal tech stack of libraries in general as developers are not bound to follow a monolithic structure. This facilitates experimentation to a much higher degree.\nComparatively simpler\nCompared to other web frameworks, even ones that are properly documented, Flask is simpler. Developers just find it much easier to get their head around Flask. This results in faster development of projects since there are fewer bottlenecks.\nSlightly better performance\nContrary to popular belief, Flask isn't significantly better in performance. That's because Python's capabilities ensure that the performance difference between Flask and other frameworks like Django are minor. However, Flask does have a minor performance advantage since it's smaller and has fewer layers.\nWider database support\nThe obvious advantage of Flask not having its own ORM system is that developers have more flexibility when it comes to database selection. They can run their database operations through SQLAlchemy as a SQL toolkit. Developers are also able to perform general database queries through SQL.\nDisadvantages\nMore expensive to maintain\nThere is a disadvantage to the less standardized tech stake of Flask. This makes it more expensive to maintain compared to a framework like Django that takes a more monolithic approach.\nNo integrated bootstrapping tool\nFlask doesn't have an integrated bootstrapping tool which means that developers can't start building web apps without any external input. They can't divide a single project into several applications or use the tool to create new applications within one project.\nDeveloper community isn’t mature enough yet\nFlask doesn't have a big and mature enough developer community behind it just yet. This means that if a developer has questions, they will find it somewhat difficult to get relevant answers through forums like Stack Overflow. Developers who face difficulties with coding in Flask or just have questions about the framework may often have to wait a while before they can get a satisfactory answer by their peers.\nMigrations can be complex\nFlask doesn't make it quite easy to undertake migration tasks compared to other frameworks like Django. The framework doesn't have a direct way to migrate the database. Developers who need to do something like this have to install the Flask-migrate library instead.\nWhich should you use?\nBoth Django and Flask have clear advantages and disadvantages. It all comes down to the unique needs of every project. The developer first needs to have a firm grasp of the project and only then will they be able to make a decision about what framework would better suit the job at hand.\nGenerally, when considering Django vs Flask, developers should opt for Django if they have limited time or are on a tight budget. This web framework is better suited to large web projects such as government websites and e-commerce platforms. It has robust security features built-in, a well-established support community with excellent documentation and an integrated ORM system for databases.\nSince this is a much more full-featured framework, it requires the developer and their team to make fewer decisions. This is something that helps out a lot when the idea is to get something done quickly.\nDevelopers who are working on small or mid-sized projects should consider using Flask as the framework. It's very simple and flexible which allows for more experimentation. Developers can thus play around with their ideas more as the framework has a customizable structure that's easily extendable.\nOne of the biggest advantages of Flask is that it's very beginner friendly so even developers who are not highly skilled can take a crack at it. Flask is better suited for small projects like single page apps and it's particularly good for prototyping.\nThe fact remains, though, that both of these popular web frameworks have made it much easier for developers to build web applications. They have actually lowered the barrier of entry so that developers of all skill levels can participate in the process.\nUltimately, it comes down to understanding the needs of the project that needs to be built. Developers should opt for Django if they're working on a large and complex project. Conversely, they should favor Flask when the objective is to build simple web applications that just need to do one thing but they need to do it right. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

    "extractedText": "BUSINESS\nHow To Pick The Right Data Visualization Tool\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n5 OCT 2018 • 4 MIN READ\nSo many data visualization tools are available these days, and this number will only increase. Picking the right one from all these various options is not a simple thing, and it can be overwhelming. You need to find the best tool for presenting your business, and there is no tool that will fall under the category “one size fits all.”\nThough the task might seem tedious, you can make it easier by identifying the right data visualization tool by analyzing and answering the following questions.\nQuestion No 1: What Kind of Questions Do Your Business Users Ask?\nDo you have any operational reporting requirements? Are you seeking to find trends? Do you know how much data you are dealing with? Is it going to be terabytes of data that is transactional or gigabytes of data that is aggregate? Do your business users have more questions than those that are listed?\nQuestion 2: What is the Skillset of Your Business Users?\nAre the business users proficient in using Excel? Do they have the ability to construct their SQL statements? Can the business users create their reports when they are using another reporting tool?\nQuestion 3: What Are Some of the Technical Resources They Have Access to?\nAre you maintaining a business analyst team separately? How big is your user base? Do you use any legacy applications and do you want to integrate them into the new solution? What flavor of database do you own (Relational database or Big Data)?\nQuestion 4: How Much Data Do You Have in Your Possession and What Is its Condition?\nAre you planning to report on terabytes of transactional data or are you planning to aggregate the data into a reporting layer? Do you want your data to pass through a transformational layer right before it reaches the reporting users? How many types of data sources do you have (i.e., flat files, web services, and databases)?\nThe answers that you find for these questions can guide you to a single tool. In some cases, these answers will help you to narrow down the options. Some of the common scenarios that come from these initial answers are as follows.\nCommon Scenarios\nFinancial Data Wranglers: These are for businesses with users who are required to distribute financial statements. They also need to find out the anomalies that are affecting the profit margins.\nPossible Solution: Using the PowerBI, they can integrate their current reports generation in Excel or SSRS. When they make this their underlying source, they can power up the analysis. This action will also make the users happy mainly because they can transfer their knowledge with ease to the new tool. Their report consumers will be glad as well because they can quickly slice and dice the pre-calculated KPIs.\nVariety of Users: Some users require visual KPIs every day in the morning. But, we also have a significant user base who are willing to put in the effort to create their reports.\nPossible Solution: Tableau is one tool that has a tremendous and beautiful looking visual set that they can use to create quick KPIs. And the best part is that they can do this with low technical overhead using its extract function. Teams can quickly learn how to use this tool and build up their analysis.\nDeep Divers: These are the companies where the primary business users also act as business analysts. The data that they want to analyze is of significant size (multiple terabytes) which also includes various source types. These users also have the task of answering numerous questions using extensive analysis in order to create real-time reports.\nPossible Solution: When they have such a comprehensive approach to data, they might require a tool that is exceedingly flexible. Looker is one great tool that is the perfect solution. It has a design that can help them in handling a substantial amount of the data. The best part is that it also comprises a robust modeling tool which can assist in quickly incorporating new data sources when they are available.\nOther Factors You Should Consider\nThere are several other factors that you may need to consider when picking a data visualization tool. They are as follows:\nDo you want the tool to be installed on a local server or do you plan to use a cloud-based solution? For example AWS or Azure?\nAre you planning to integrate legacy solutions that might require custom code bridges? Do you think it makes sense to use Amazon Lambda or Azure functions which might act as “serverless” bridge?\nWill your customers access the information or data remotely? Are you planning to use a real cloud infrastructure such as Tableau Online?\nWhat type of skill set does your team have? Are you employing full-time JavaScript developers in your group? If you wish to have a customizable experience, D3 will be of interest to you.\nPicking the right data visualization tool requires you to balance both the analytical and technical needs. You should determine not only the training schedules but also consider adding new components to the current technical architecture if required. There might be times when it feels like your needs are competing with each other, but with careful consideration, you can pick the right tool. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

A Python development company can adapt to your changing needs and requirements as your startup grows. They can also scale up or down the resources and manpower as needed.\nPowerup Your Startup by Partnering With a Python Development Company\nWhat do I need to consider if I choose Python for my Business’s App?\nPython is not a perfect language. It has its own limitations and drawbacks that you need to be aware of before choosing it for your business's app. Here are some of the things you need to consider if you choose Python for your business's app:\n- Python is not the fastest language. Python is an interpreted language, which means it runs slower than compiled languages like C or Java. This can affect the performance of your app, especially if it involves intensive calculations or operations.\n- Python is not the most secure language. Python is a dynamic language, which means it does not have strict type checking or static analysis. This can make your code more prone to errors and vulnerabilities, such as injection attacks or memory leaks unlike in .NET\nWhat Challenges Might I Face?\nChoosing Python for your business's app can also bring some challenges that you need to overcome. Here are some of the common challenges that you might face:\n- Finding and hiring qualified Python developers. Python is a popular language, but it is also a competitive one. There is a high demand for skilled Python developers, but there is also a shortage of supply. Finding and hiring qualified Python developers can be difficult and expensive, especially if you need them urgently or for a long-term project.\n- Managing and maintaining your Python code. As your app grows in size and complexity, so does your Python code. You need to make sure that your code is well-structured, well-documented, and well-maintained.\n- Testing and debugging your Python code. Testing and debugging your Python code can be challenging, especially if you use multiple libraries and frameworks that may have different behaviors or dependencies. You need to use appropriate testing tools and techniques to ensure the functionality and quality of your code. You also need to use proper debugging tools and methods to identify and fix any errors or bugs in your code.\nThe Scalability of Python\nOne of the main concerns that many startup founders have when choosing a programming language for their app is scalability. Scalability refers to the ability of an app to handle increasing amounts of data, traffic, or users without compromising performance or quality.\nPython is a scalable language, but it also has some limitations that you need to be aware of. Here are some of the factors that affect the scalability of Python:\n- The choice of framework. The framework that you use for your app can have a significant impact on its scalability. Some frameworks are more scalable than others, depending on their design and features. For example, Django is a popular framework for web development, but it is not very scalable due to its synchronous and blocking nature. On the other hand, Flask is a lightweight framework that is more scalable due to its asynchronous and non-blocking nature.\nBenefits of partnering with a Python App Development Company\nIf you decide to use Python for your startup app development project , you may wonder whether you should hire an in-house team of developers or outsource it to an external company.\nThere are pros and cons to both options but outsourcing has some significant advantages especially for startups such as:\n- Cost-effectiveness: Hiring an in-house team of developers can be expensive especially if you need to recruit, train, and retain them. You also need to provide them with the necessary resources and infrastructure to work. Outsourcing can save you a lot of money by allowing you to pay only for the work done and avoiding the overhead costs of hiring and managing employees.\n- Time-efficiency: Building an in-house team of developers can take a lot of time especially if you need to find the right candidates, conduct interviews, and onboard them. You also need to coordinate and communicate with them regularly to ensure the quality and progress of the project. Outsourcing can save you a lot of time by allowing you to access a pool of experienced and skilled developers who can start working on your project immediately and deliver it faster.\n- Quality: Finding and hiring qualified and talented developers can be challenging especially in a competitive market. You also need to ensure that they have the right skills and knowledge for your project and that they can work well together as a team. Outsourcing can ensure the quality of your project by allowing you to work with a reputable and reliable company that has proven expertise and experience in Python development and that can provide you with a dedicated team of developers who can meet your expectations and requirements.\nWhy Startups Choose Zibtek’s Python Development Company?\nZibtek is a leading Python development company that specializes in building custom web\nand mobile apps for startups.

Any organization that's looking to modernize its IT infrastructure needs to ensure that the various systems it relies upon are properly integrated.\nThose who don't utilize modern IT solutions risk falling behind the competition. The world of business is fast-paced and it's quick to leave behind organizations that don't adapt with the times. Relying on seamlessly integrated IT services is thus crucial to making it big in the industry.\nIt’s a recipe for chaos, otherwise. An organization will not be efficient and its processes will not be streamlined if team members have to juggle between different software, systems, data models, and more just to get the job done. There has to be a simpler and more efficient way of doing things, and that’s exactly what IT system integration enables.\nWhat is IT system integration?\nThe textbook definition of IT system integration is actually quite simple. System integration is when multiple individual IT subsystems or sub-components are combined into one singular system that functions as one cohesive unit. It's this linking together of the different IT systems that enables them to work together without running into any issues.\nThe task covers both virtual and physical components, with the latter consisting of the various machine systems that have been deployed in the organization. They can include computer hardware, inventory, and more. The virtual component of system integration deals with databases, software, and applications.\nUltimately, the goal with IT system integration is to bring all of these components together so that they act as one. It is extremely important for both business-to-business communication as well as streamlining internal processes. Achieving optimum efficiency in the business can often be difficult without this.\nWhat services are offered by systems integration specialists\nAs you may have guessed by now, systems integration is a job that’s best left to the experts. There’s a significant amount of technical expertise required to perform integration tasks, particularly for organizations that use a lot of different IT systems and hardware. If not done properly, there’s a solid chance of things going horribly wrong.\nThere’s no shortage of service providers out there that offer systems integration services. However, your mileage with them will vary depending on the level of their experience and the kind of service that they provide.\nIt’s better to always first understand what sort of services are offered by the provider that you’re looking at before hiring them to do the job. This will give you the peace of mind that the people you’re hired to do the job are right for it.\nThe services that these specialists offer include designing the one cohesive system into which all of the different subsystems will be integrated. They can also carry out functional and user testing on the system to ensure that there are no disruptions when it does go live.\nOther services may include program integration and management, depending on the unique needs of the organization. Those that utilize custom solutions can also work with their specialists to have their custom solutions integrated into the new system.\nA step by step guide to a system integration project\nSince system integration is a complex process, it’s always best to have a proper plan in place first before embarking on the job. This will reduce the chances of any issues arising during the integration task and will lead to a higher chance of the project being completed without any problems.\nGathering Requirements\nGathering the requirements for the project is the very first step. This is when you meet with your system integration consultant and explain to them the requirements that you have for the new system. This will allow them to execute the project based on the unique needs of your business.\nAnalyze Operational Feasibility\nOnce you have decided what the specifications of the new system will be, analyze the operational feasibility of the proposed system for your business. This will allow the service provider to bring their vision for the project in line with the goals of your business. It will also help reduce friction with the development team.\nCreate Integration Blueprints\nA detailed plan is then required for the system integrator before they start working on the project. The integration blueprint will give them a solid foundation to work on, as they will know exactly which components need to be integrated and in what manner to achieve the desired objective.\nIntegration Design\nThis is one of the most important steps of the job and also it's often the most challenging. This is where the actual work is performed, in that the multiple subsystems are integrated together. This step should go off without a hitch if the earlier steps have been followed correctly.\nThe primary concern here is obviously data retention. Extreme care is to be taken during this stage to make sure that no data is lost during the integration process. As always, it’s best to create solid backups before embarking on projects where the risk of data loss is present.\nTesting and Implementation\nAs with anything related to software, thorough testing is required before the integrated system is implemented. The idea here is to figure out if there are any bugs or issues that need to be ironed out before the organization can become entirely reliant on the new system.\nIf any bugs are detected during this stage, they're fixed and engineers test the system once again to make sure that everything is operating as it should be. This is also the part where you ensure that everyone in the organization is trained on how to use the new system.\nMaintenance\nFor most organizations, systems integration is never a one-time job. There's a need for constant maintenance to ensure that no other bugs surface down the line, or any new components can be integrated as and when the need may arise.\nOrganizations evolve with time and their technical needs do, too. Therefore, it's vital to have ongoing support so that any future needs can be addressed.\nWhat are some of the challenges of system integration?\nThe systems integration process can prove to be very challenging, particularly if it's going to be a very complex project. Most organizations are heavily dependent on legacy systems and it's usually not easy to get rid of those systems. It becomes all the more challenging for system integrators to figure out the best way of integrating with monolithic systems.\nTrying to find the right tool for integration can often be a chore as well. There's no shortage of tools on the market that claim to provide the best and simplest integration experience. It's imperative for the tool to have support for hybrid integration, so that on-premise applications can easily be integrated with cloud applications.\nAnother challenge that organizations routinely run into when executing a system integration project is having to arrive at a standard data model. The data requirements are different for every business unit and they're often using different systems to collect and analyze that data. This can lead to a disconnect between the data models, thereby making the process of integration more complex.\nTime and cost constraints always add more complexity to any integration project. Your organization may be pressed for time and you might want the project to be completed as soon as possible. There could be cost overruns as well if the project runs into some issues and that can add a level of uncertainty to the project that’s best avoided.\nZibtek can help you integrate your new software safely\nThe success of your integration project depends on the integration specialist that you choose to work with. You’ll have no shortage of options when you go out to hire one, but it’s imperative that you choose the service provider that you feel confident about.\nZibtek can certainly give you the confidence that it will tackle your project with the utmost dedication and care.

Look for These Teammates and Qualities.\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n23 OCT 2023 • 7 MIN READ\nOutsourcing software development to India is like hiring a band to play at your wedding. You want talented musicians who can deliver a great performance, but you also want reliable partners who can work with you on the details, such as the playlist, the schedule, the equipment, and the budget. You don't want to end up with a band that shows up late, plays off-key, or charges you extra for every song.\nBut how do you find the right band for your wedding? Or, in this case, the right software developers for your project? Here are some tips on what to look for and what to avoid when outsourcing to India.\nWhy outsourcing software development to India?\nThere are many reasons why outsourcing software development to India makes sense for businesses of all sizes and industries. Some of the main benefits are:\n- Cost savings: According to a report by Deloitte, outsourcing software development to India can save up to 60% of the total project cost compared to hiring in-house developers in the US or Europe. This is because of the lower wages, taxes, and overhead costs in India.\n- Quality work: India is renowned for its extensive talent pool of highly skilled and experienced software developers, consistently delivering work that aligns with international standards and best practices. According to Nasscom's report, India boasts a workforce of over 4.5 million IT professionals and annually produces more than 1.5 million engineering graduates. However, it's important to note that while the talent pool is substantial, the implementation of rigorous recruiting practices remains a crucial factor in harnessing this potential effectively.\n- Time efficiency: Outsourcing software development to India can help you speed up your project delivery and reduce your time-to-market. This is because of the time zone difference, which allows you to have round-the-clock communication and collaboration with your outsourced team. You can also leverage the agile methodology, which enables faster feedback and iterations.\n- Innovation: Outsourcing software development to India can help you access new ideas and technologies that can enhance your product and give you a competitive edge. India is a hub of innovation and entrepreneurship, with over 50,000 startups and 34 unicorns as of 2020. India also ranks third in the Global Innovation Index 2020 among lower-middle-income countries.\nOutsourcing to India? Look for These Teammates and Qualities.\nWhy India?\nIndia is not the only country that offers outsourcing services for software development. There are other options, such as China, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. So why choose India over these alternatives?\nHere are some reasons why India stands out as a preferred destination for outsourcing software development:\n- Language proficiency: India has the second-largest English-speaking population in the world, after the US. English is widely used as a medium of education, business, and communication in India. This makes it easier for you to communicate with your outsourced team and avoid misunderstandings or errors due to language barriers.\n- Cultural compatibility: India has a diverse and multicultural society that is open and adaptable to different cultures and values. India also shares a strong historical and cultural bond with many Western countries, especially the US and the UK. This makes it easier for you to build rapport and trust with your outsourced team and avoid conflicts or clashes due to cultural differences.\n- Legal framework: India has a robust and transparent legal system that protects the rights and interests of both parties in an outsourcing contract. India is a signatory to several international treaties and conventions that govern intellectual property rights, data protection, arbitration, and dispute resolution. This makes it easier for you to safeguard your confidential information, intellectual property, and contractual obligations when outsourcing to India.\nCharacteristics to look for in an outsourced teammate\nNow that you know why outsourcing software development to India is a good idea, how do you find the right outsourced teammates for your project? Here are some characteristics that you should look for when hiring software developers from India:\n- Technical skills: The most obvious and important characteristic that you should look for in an outsourced teammate is their technical skills. You want someone who has the relevant expertise, experience, and certifications in the technologies and tools that you need for your project. You can assess their technical skills by reviewing their portfolio, resume, references, testimonials, or online profiles. You can also conduct technical tests or interviews to verify their skills.\n- Communication skills: Another crucial characteristic that you should look for in an outsourced teammate is their communication skills. You want someone who can communicate clearly, effectively, and professionally with you and your stakeholders. You can assess their communication skills by observing their written and spoken communication, such as their emails, messages, calls, or video conferences. You can also check their feedback ratings or reviews from previous clients or employers.\n- Work ethic: A third essential characteristic that you should look for in an outsourced teammate is their work ethic. You want someone who is reliable, responsible, and responsive. You want someone who can meet deadlines, follow instructions, deliver quality work, and handle changes or challenges. You can assess their work ethic by tracking their progress, performance, and productivity using tools such as Jira, Trello, or Slack. You can also ask for regular updates or reports from them or their managers.\nWhat are some red flags?\nWhile there are many good and trustworthy software developers in India, there are also some bad and shady ones that you should avoid. Here are some red flags that you should watch out for when outsourcing to India:\n- Low rates: If the rates offered by an outsourced teammate are too low to be true, they probably are. Low rates may indicate low quality, low skills, or low reliability. They may also indicate hidden costs, such as extra fees, taxes, or charges that are not disclosed upfront. You should always compare the rates with the market average and the value that you expect to get from the project.\n- Poor communication: If an outsourced teammate is not responsive, clear, or professional in their communication, they may not be trustworthy or competent. Poor communication may indicate poor understanding, poor execution, or poor collaboration. It may also indicate a lack of interest, commitment, or respect for your project. You should always establish clear and frequent communication channels and expectations with your outsourced team.\n- Unrealistic promises: If an outsourced teammate makes unrealistic promises, such as delivering a complex project in a short time frame, or guaranteeing a flawless product without any testing or feedback, they may not be honest or realistic. Unrealistic promises may indicate a lack of experience, expertise, or resources. They may also indicate a lack of integrity, transparency, or accountability. You should always set realistic and measurable goals and milestones for your project.\nHow Zibtek is Revolutionizing Outsourcing With Workforce+\nZibtek is a leading software development company that offers outsourcing services to clients across the globe.

    "extractedText": "Technical Product Management\nIan J.H Reynolds\nExplore Ian J.H Reynolds' expertise in finance and economics through his insightful articles on market trends, investment strategies, and economic analysis.\nMore posts by Ian J.H Reynolds.\nIAN J.H REYNOLDS\n8 JUL 2020 • 6 MIN READ\nThe success or failure of your product depends on a number of factors. If it's not a quality product, chances are that your prospects may not convert into customers. The same could also be true if it's priced too high in comparison to competitors and offers no meaningful benefits over the rest of the field.\nIt also depends on the teams that are tasked with selling it, improving it, providing customer support, and more. In that case, there needs to be a resource that can act as a point person for the product. They bring together the different teams that work on the product, promote cohesion between them and make it their mission to ensure that the product does well.\nThat's basically the job requirement of a conventional product manager role. The same also holds true for technical product managers, even though they’re required to have a lot more specific knowledge. That’s because they bridge the gap between the development team and the rest of the organization. They play a vital role in helping the organization achieve success.\nWhat is technical product management?\n\"Technical\" is the magic word here, it's the entire difference between conventional product management and technical product management. The latter requires a person that has a strong technical background. They need to have specific knowledge about the technical aspects of your product.\nFor example, if your organization offers a particular software product, the technical product manager can’t be someone who has no knowledge of how that software works, the platform it has been developed for, and the language that it has been coded in. The person you choose for this role needs to be proficient in these technical matters.\nThat's because technical product managers are required to work closely with the engineering team as opposed to the sales, marketing, and business teams. The people chosen for these roles have often served in direct engineering roles themselves or have a strong computer science background.\nWhat does a technical product manager do?\nThe technical product manager needs to have a solid understanding of your company's technology. They need to have the requisite skills which enable them to come up with a long-term vision for the product, create a roadmap for its development and continue to engage with the development team to further improve it.\nMost organizations actually split the business and technical product management between two persons. One will be more of a conventional product manager that focuses on every aspect but the technical bits. On the other hand, the technical product manager would focus solely on the technical side of the product. Both resources will work to achieve the singular goal of ensuring that the product is in its best possible version.\nManage a product’s vision\nIt's vital for an organization to know that the vision for its product is. That's what defines exactly what the technical specs of that product are going to be, what it will be able to help customers do and precisely how it needs to be developed in order to achieve all of those objects.\nA technical product manager will be focused on developing a vision for the product. They would get the market's pulse in order to form a clear picture of what the customers' needs might be. Once they have formed an understanding of this, they can then create a roadmap which the development team needs to follow in order to create a product that will do exactly what the market needs it to do.\nMake a product roadmap\nWhen creating the roadmap for the product, the technical product manager has to closely work with the development manager or the development team. This entails explaining them exactly what the product requirements are and forming an understanding of the time required for the work to be completed.\nThis is also the stage at which it becomes evident if there are any dependencies or difficulties that need to be addressed during the development stage. Technical product managers will also assess and address any technical risks as well as define the success criteria for testing and product acceptance.\nThe roadmap will help the development team get a sense of what their time constraints are and precisely what they need to do and when in order to meet the timeline. This helps reduce uncertainty and increases the chances of the project being completed on time.\nDo market research\nMarket research is an extremely important part of a technical product manager’s job. Their primary duty is to understand what the needs of the customers are and then translate them into technical requirements for the development team. This, in turn, makes the development team’s job easier.\nThey know exactly what they have to do and why. Thorough market research gives them clarity on the efficacy of the features that they’re going to spend countless hours developing. The technical product manager will also provide them with requirements for quality assurance and testing as well as the implementation plans after conducting their research.\nIt's vital for any organization to keep up with the trends in the industry or else they risk being left behind. The technical product manager should have a keen eye for trends and they should be able to quickly spot what the competition is doing. They can then pass on their observations and recommendations to the developers and engineers so that the product can be further improved in order to maintain its competitive edge.\nInterface with the product owner\nOrganizations that use the agile development approach have product owners that are more tactical in their role in comparison to product managers. The latter is essentially focused on the big picture stuff. They're supposed to create the vision, set out objectives and keep an eye on the market.\nIt's the job of the product owners to translate the strategy provided by the product managers into actionable tasks. They work with different teams across the entire organization to ensure that the strategy is being implemented in letter and spirit.\nFor the organization to achieve its intended objectives, the technical product manager and the product owner have to work together closely. This dynamic partnership is key to maximizing the value of the product throughout the development process.\nPerform risk assessment\nOne of the core responsibilities of a technical product manager is to own and manage the risk. They need to have the capability to assess and call out risks throughout the many stages of product development. These risks can be related to the timeline, scope, costs, customer requirements, market trends, and more.\nThe risk profile obviously varies from product to product, but the job remains as important as ever. Regardless of whether it's a strategic or an executional risk, the product manager has to properly identify, assess and then provide a strategy to mitigate that risk before it causes unwanted disruption.\nThere's a risk involved in every decision that's made. The product vision needs to be achieved without a shadow of doubt. So when there is doubt, product managers need to ask the right questions and interface with the relevant stakeholders in order to get a firm grasp on the situation. They can then utilize the data and other insights before making an informed decision.\nWhy you need a technical product manager\nYou need this resource for your product as they will help you create a vision and a strategy to achieve it. They will study the market, gather and promote the most relevant ideas that need to be incorporated in your product. The roadmap that they create will help plan and prioritize what needs to be done and when.\nThey have their finger on the pulse and are able to effectively communicate to the development team what features they need to build and why. The product manager will also work with different teams within the organization to develop a solid go-to-market strategy that increases the chances of your product being successful.\nYou don’t necessarily have to hire a technical product manager as an employee, there are service providers that you can work with who can assign such resources to you on a per-project basis. Zibtek is one of those service providers, with a global talent pool of highly skilled technical product managers.\nZibtek is one of the world’s leading software development companies.

When you get promoted to a team manager, it is only your leadership skills that can set you apart from the rest. You must aim to become a good leader instead of becoming a boss.\nMany people do not understand the difference between being a leader and being a boss. Here are some of the traits that you need to inculcate if you intend to become a good leader.\nKnow Your People\nYou MUST take time from your busy schedule to learn about the people who report to you. Know their strengths and weaknesses. Once you identify the strengths of a person, you can create an environment for the employee to exhibit his talents. For example, if an employee has good rapport with the customers and he enjoys doing it, put him in a forward-facing role. Do not have him to do some other job. Have him do things that energize him and can bring a positive influence on others around him. Spare some time to know the employees who report to you better. You should know about their likes, ambitions and their family. Ensure that they have a proper work-life balance. These little things help the employees that report to you to become more loyal. People become interested in taking your feedback when you are concerned about their well-being. They trust whatever you are going to say because they see that you want them to improve.\nThink Like the Employee\nYour employees want to succeed in their career. They want to get the promotion or get recognition for the work that they do. You will realize that you as well want to get recognition for every good work that you do from your boss. Put in the best efforts from your end to help your employees succeed and achieve their goals. Start appreciating the people who work with you and they soon will reciprocate it in many ways.\nA Good Boss Inspires Others\nInspire Others With Your Work. Anyone can boss people around, as it does not need much effort. But to become an inspirational leader, you need to put in a lot of hard work. It requires you to have passion, dedication, and love for the work that you do. Look at the work that you have at hand and find ways to improve the processes at the work. No one wants to work for someone who bosses them around but they would jump at an opportunity to work with an inspirational leader.\nFix the Problems\nDo not be that boss who you can’t find when there is an issue but one that puts in extra efforts to fix the problems. You lose the trust of your employees when you try to pass the buck and blame someone when a mistake happens. Work is very much like life as they are full of mishaps and mistakes.\nOf course, some errors are quite serious, while there are others that are not. Give clear instructions and communicate regularly and you can avoid unnecessary mistakes at work. Be honest with your employees when something goes wrong. Always be quick to find solutions to the problems that arise.\nGive Feedback\nTo build a great workplace, some managers stop giving feedback to their employees. But after observing their performance going down, they pounce at them making them feel terrible. If you are concerned about a person in the team, take time to meet them. Give an honest feedback that can help them improve their performance. It is your responsibility to help your employees find what they are lacking. It is also your responsibility to help them address them.\nFriends and Leaders\nWhen you get promoted, there are times when you have to lead a team that also has your former colleagues or peers. Just because you are their friend, you should not let personal issues affect the business. It is vital for them as well as you to understand the boundaries of friendship and leadership. Do not show any favoritism to a particular member of your team because you know them. Never engage in gossip as it can spoil the morale of your team. Do not share any confidential information with your friends. It does not mean that you have to give them the cold shoulder. Note, work should not affect your relationship outside the workplace.\nListen To Your Employees\nIt is a common practice that once the boss makes an opinion known, everyone else goes along with it. But you must listen to your team members before giving your thoughts. You should also encourage everyone to share their opinions and thoughts openly. It helps you understand the situation from various perspectives before making a decision. These are some of the most critical attributes that will help you become a better leader.

    "extractedText": "BUSINESS\nTop Ways To Be A Great Startup CEO\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n13 NOV 2018 • 4 MIN READ\nThere is an incorrect notion in many people’s mind as they think that being a CEO for a startup is a glamorous job. And some believe that being CEO of a fledgling tech company is full of fun. These kinds of ideas came into existence because of how the press depicts the life of the startup team. Some articles that are published by press claim that raising money or getting more users is an easy and effortless thing. There is lots of emphasis on office ping-pong tables and gourmet coffee.\nThey also state the being a CEO for a startup is something that is adventurous. While there is some truth to this, one should recognize the fact that being a CEO is not such an easy job as people think it to be. Not every founder of a company can become a successful entrepreneur. And to achieve success there will likely be a lot of hard work.\nCertain traits set apart the best from the rest. Here is an excellent list of some of those essential characteristics that the best CEO possess.\nNo 1: Keeper of the Vision\nOne thing that a CEO of a startup should have is a vision for the company. And this vision is not just for a few months but for a more extended period. He or she has to keep things on course in the current quarter so that the company can achieve its sizeable overarching vision. As a startup, it is true that you cannot reach your global vision in a year or two, because you are often starting from square one.\nIn some cases, it might take almost a decade. Google is one of the classic examples of this. A good CEO will take time to judge upcoming initiatives and also see if they fit in as a piece of the puzzle in a bigger vision.\nNo 2: Absorbs the Pain\nA startup CEO should more or less act like a voodoo doll for the team in a personal way. They should be ready to take the stress, pain, and anxiety of the rest of the team, and at the same time make some rational decisions. It is essential for him or her to ensure that none of the troop members are getting overly stressed out or worrying too much about the challenges that they are facing.\nA good startup CEO is one who can absorb the stress so that the team can focus on their work and carry on. He or she should be one who can mask both their pain and stress. It does not mean he or should start lying to the team; some transparency benefits everyone. But it is essential for your team not to be aware of and worry about the day-to-day nuances and stresses.\nNo 3: Hire Smart People and Defer Domain Expertise\nA good CEO has a knack for choosing or hiring the best talent. The key to picking the right people is to find people who are smarter than you in specific topics. You might want to do this when you are planning to hire a new VP, Biz Dev or the technical team members. After finding these people, it is essential for you to hire them. Now, this is the most challenging problem.\nYou should be able to convince them to leave their job by looking at your passion and fire for the vision of your startup. A good CEO will not simply hire smart people but will trust them with the work and defer to them for domain expertise. While it is difficult to let go of things, that’s what you need to do if you want the company to progress.\nNo 4: Good Link Between Investors and the Company\nIt is necessary for you to realize the fact that you are not the only company that the investor may have in their portfolio. Even if you are doing well, they have several other companies to think about in a given year. Now, this is what makes a good investor. As a startup CEO, it is essential for you to act as a link between the investors and the company.\nYou should regularly update them with progress reports of your company as well as areas of concerns and issues and take the necessary assistance or help from them. An early startup that has raised some money will have three people on the board: the CEO founder, the investor and lastly an independent board member. You are the lone representative for both your co-founder as well as other employees.\nNo 5: Ability to Say No\nSince you are the CEO of the company, you may get flooded with requests. These can come from the investors, potential partners, employees, and others. Most of these requests may sound great in theory but be a drain if you agree to too many. There is a possibility to execute most of them when your business is growing. But, at times it is wise to say no instead of saying yes. It is the only way you are going to keep the company on the track and achieve the vision that you have.\nNo 6: Motivate Your Team\nIn this business, people love to talk a lot. Now, this happens a lot more when your company is not faring well. A great CEO is one who can take in the public despair during those moments, and they are the ones who can keep their company focused. They can debunk rumors if there are any and assist the members of the company in focusing on the bigger mission. Keeping gossip and low morale to a minimum can keep the team focused on cohesion and working toward goals.\nA great CEO can bring in the required motivation with a 5-minute talk or an email. It is essential for you to not shy away from addressing your team’s concerns.\nThere are many different ways to be a great startup CEO, but among all the best CEOs there are common themes. These are just a few of the elements that can help to ensure your success. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

It is an art that is capable of creating those experiences that will encourage not only human interaction but also assists in mapping behavior to yield anticipated results or outcomes.\nUnderstanding Skeuomorphism\nSkeuomorphism is one word that is widely used in graphical user design interface. It is used to describe mainly the interface objects which seem to mimic their counterparts in the real world. They tend to appear and interact with the user exactly like their real-world counterpart.\nSkeuomorphism was one of the most important things that developers need to consider when they first introduced computer interfaces. It was used primarily to help people transition to digital devices. Since people were more accustomed to using real-world devices, this enabled them to become comfortable when they were using a digital tool.\nFor example, if you notice, a skeuomorphic calculator looks like a real-world calculator. People who used the physical device found it easy to use the digital calculator with ease as nothing was different. The numbers and features that you see in the digital calculator resemble well the real-world calculator with accuracy. Users do not find trouble using digital tools as a result.\nLost Its Glory\nAll was going well with the skeuomorphic design for a long time. But with the advent of touch screens, the rise in the new operating system patterns, flat design, and minimalism, skeuomorphism slowly started to fade away in popularity.\nThe Hamburger Menu\nFor example, if we take into consideration the hamburger menu that is now quite popular in most of the apps and websites, you will understand why skeuomorphism lost its grip. Now, this kind of interaction did not ever exist in the real world. This particular interaction found its spot only in the digital interfaces. The main reason why designers developed this interaction is actually to conserve the space in a UI that is confined. It also provides standardized affordance allowing the users to toggle quickly between additional settings and navigation.\nRise of Minimalism\nIn a nutshell, it is nothing but the usage of barest as well as fewest essentials to develop the user experiences. As a result, every interaction and element will now have a refined, proven and scoped purpose. An early proliferation of the designs that are skeuomorphic led to the rise of minimalism. It is because interfaces were becoming more complex and experiences as well were becoming unusable and a lot more cluttered.\nAs a result, skeuomorphism became not just limiting but also inelegant. Since we as users have significantly evolved, it has led to the reduction of tolerance and attention span towards friction. We are interested no longer in spending so much time trying to find value from experience. We now are very eager to get the value immediately as we are now tuned to orient ourselves almost instantaneously to see things that we want.\nThe best part is that the web technologies as well have evolved drastically. Designers without sacrificing much on the system performance have the power now to create animations that are beautiful and content presentations that are quite elegant.\nSmart devices and new browsers are now coming out with powered interactions kit. As a result, they are quite helpful in providing feedback that is responsive to almost all actions and gestures. Now, the question is who would like to dial circularly with the fingers when there is an option to use the slider?\nUnderstanding the Controversy\nSkeuomorphism has critics who think that the designers instead of making experiences ended up making theatrics. The classic example of this is the iPad’s new version of the e-reader. It almost looks like a real book. Critics feel that as a designer you should only adopt specific real-world styles and affordances to existing user experience. Nuances and excessive gradients tend to make a UI cluttered, and users will find it difficult to use it.\nCritics firmly believe that skeuomorphic designs sacrificed things such as interface scalability, navigability, and ease of use. Since skeuomorphic designs rely heavily on ratios and proportions that are well defined, it is quite hard to scale it. The design community has now moved towards using standardized, flatter and ambiguous design styles. These designs adapt well to responsiveness – you can fit them well on mobile, web, or the tablet.\nThe Need For Resurgence\nDigitalization of things is now catching the attention of everyone. Everything that you can find in the market like cars, watches and even appliances are using it. IoT or Internet of Things is now bringing back skeuomorphic design in the forefront of the design thinking. Now, the user wants to interact with objects from the real world rather than flat surfaces such as a tablet or phone screen. Apple Watch is a good example. While we were conditioned to use it to check the time, it does a lot more than indicating the time.\nSince there is the rise of augmented or virtual reality, we can interact with the objects now in the real world simulation. Besides touching and feeling the digital objects, we can now place them over the top of surfaces. Experiencing real-world physics now in the digital arena is possible as a result.\nWe are in so much need of skeuomorphic design now than ever before. But we should soon learn to adapt. We should shun the concept of imitating physical-world experiences. Instead, we should deconstruct our physical interactions and stick to the basic elements. That is to gain an understanding of the physics in the real world and then to apply some of the affordances that you observe to create the digital interactions. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

    "extractedText": "Python Mobile App Development Tools\nVedant Vyas\nRead more posts by this author.\nVEDANT VYAS\n12 JUL 2021 • 3 MIN READ\nPython mobile app development has become a favorite choice for many developers—so much so, it’s close to becoming their #1 programming language. It’s easy to see why; they can use Python for a wide range of tasks. It’s appropriate for small and vast-scale web development projects and allows for the cross-platform development of apps for PCs and mobile devices.\nPrincipally used for data analysis, web development, and DevOps tasks, Python has long been valued for its simplicity and low cost. Even modern giants like Spotify, Instagram, and Netflix chose the tool for their websites’ backends. This post takes a look at how two programs, Kivy and BeeWare, make Python-driven mobile app development possible.\nWhat is Python Mobile App Development?\nCreated by Guido van Rossum in 1991, Python’s a powerful tool popular with both beginners and seasoned developers. The open-source, general-purpose programming language allows for relatively quick code creating and:\nIs easy to learn and understand.\nWorks well with big data.\nCan integrate with other programming languages.\nPython comes with dozens of reliable libraries and frameworks that let you create one codebase for various platforms such as iOS and Android, a huge advantage in mobile app development. Where developers once had to use different programming languages to create separate apps for both operating systems, they can now easily transform one piece of code into versions that work across platforms.\nKivy & BeeWare: Using Python for Mobile App Development\nIt wasn’t that long ago that Python mobile app development was nearly a pipedream. But as the number of mobile users increased, engineers looked for a way to enable Python to build mobile apps.\nKivy\nWhen the Kivy framework was released in 2011, it opened up a path for cross-platform development of PC and mobile device apps. The open-source solution uses a custom set of UI instruments that engage the same control elements on different platforms. These widgets are not rendered using native platform UI controls, which has its pros and cons.\nOn the plus side, it guarantees an app's consistency and portability from one platform to another.\nOn the other hand, it means an Android or iOS won’t always look and feel like other platform-specific apps.\nDepending on the type of app you’re developing, it might not matter how native an app “feels.” For instance, it’s usually of little concern for gaming apps or niche apps like controllers used to create music. For other types of apps, though, it can seriously affect usability.\nKivy, then, is an excellent tool for developers who can work with a non-native UI toolkit in their apps as you can write mobile apps using Python programming skills without needing to learn another platform-specific language like Swift.\nBeeWare\nThe tools and libraries included in another framework, the BeeWare project, allow developers to “write once, deploy everywhere.” In the platform, widgets, buttons, check boxes, and other features act as UI controllers or “stage managers” that help developers build robust software quickly and easily.\nUnlike Kivy, BeeWare uses the native UI toolkit of the platform your app runs on. For instance, in BeeWare, your app’s UI controls will be the same buttons, check boxes, and form elements the underlying operating system provides. You can build mobile apps that look and feel 100% native to Android, iOS, or PC platforms.\nDoes BeeWare have any downsides? Only that it’s a relatively young framework that’s still under heavy development. That might translate into more work for developers due to bugs, API changes, and lack of features.\nMobile App Development Tools\nThanks to these two major Python mobile app development frameworks, developers can now write mobile apps in Python and release them on multiple platforms. They no longer need to rewrite apps in multiple programming languages, which means no issues with build tools, compatibility, environment, and more.\nBoth Kivy and BeeWare are worth considering for Python mobile app development. It all comes down to personal preference and usability considerations. Outsourcing with a python development company can help you kick start your project.

    "extractedText": "Top 7 PHP FRAMEWORKS\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n5 SEP 2019 • 7 MIN READ\nPHP frameworks provide you the assurance that the applications you are developing are well-structured, can be upgraded, are maintainable, and are in full compliance with the business protocols. They enable developers to re-use the modules in the application development, thus saving them a lot of time. Their use also simplifies and speeds up the web development process.\nThere is no denying the fact that the PHP framework will continue to gain popularity. In this article, we have listed the top 7 PHP frameworks that you can use to develop a high-quality web application.\nPHP Frameworks\n1. Laravel\nLaravel is the most popular free and open-source PHP framework that can securely handle even the most complex web applications with ease. With its robust ecosystem, it makes the common tasks easier, like session handling, routing, caching, authentication, etc.\nWhy should you consider Laravel for web development?\nWith Laravel, you don’t have to worry if your application requires complex and flexible back-end. Laravel can be used to build robust applications with complex back-end, no matter how large or small your application is.\nTo make the entire PHP development process smooth, Laravel offers Homestead, an official pre-packaged Vagrant box (a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments in an elegant way) that offers you an amazing development environment to build applications. Moreover, it does not require you to install a web server, PHP, or any other software server on your local machine.\nIt is a featured-packed framework that enables you to customize the complex apps easily, including security, authentication, data migration and more.\nLavarel facilitates high security and speed that is necessary for modern web applications and enterprise applications.\nLatest release: Laravel 6\n2.Symfony\nThe Symfony PHP framework was launched in 2005 and is considered one of the most mature and reliable platforms. Under an open-source license, it offers the following benefits:\n. It is publicly accessible to every user for free.\n. Expertise developers can inspect, modify and enhance this framework (while following the secure approach and standardized practice) that will help other developers.\n. Symfony is easy to set up, install and configure on different platforms, making web development fun.\n. Symfony is a set of reusable PHP components that can easily be used by developers. They don’t require developers to write a lot of code, devoting more time to more productive things that can add value to your business.\n. Symfony is a highly flexible framework and can integrate well with other software components. It lowers the risk of error and also enhances the productivity of developers.\nDespite offering so many great features, Symfony is a bit hard to start. Symfony is mostly adopted by advanced developers only. Whereas, Lavarel is simple enough that even intermediate developers can understand and use it.\nLatest version:Symfony 4.7.0\nSimple PHP Framework\n3. Codelgniter\nCodeIgniter is a simple PHP framework that is well-suited for building dynamic web-based applications. It provides a wide range of built-in modules that developers used to create robust components. Codelgniter is a lightweight framework, only about 2MB in size, including its user guide.\nWhy should you consider Codelgniter for web development?\nIt is lightweight and easy to install and use. Its user-guide is also so well-explained and simple that even beginners can easily understand, use and implement it.\nCodeIgniter is best for you if:\n1.Your web application requires high-performance and high-execution speed.\n2.You want clear and concise documentation in order to learn CodeIgnitor.\n3.You want to build lightweight web applications that are meant to run on moderate servers.\n4.You need a framework that requires no configuration at all.\nWith its essential features, including Model View Controller (MVC) architecture, ready-made security tools, and exceptional error-handling, it is widely used to create scalable and flexible applications.\nThe current version of CodeIgnitor is CodeIgnitor 3, licensed under MIT license.\nThe upcoming version of CodeIgnitor is CodeIgnitor 4, licensed under MIT license.\nSome disadvantages of CodeIgniter that you should know:\n1. Applications built using CodeIgnitor cannot be run on high-intensity and huge servers.\n2. Not suitable for the applications that need advanced-level security, since CodeIngnitor upgrades and releases are irregular.\n4. CakePHP\nCakePHP is based on the modern PHP7 framework. It is built to make common web-development tasks easy, simple and fast, without requiring developers to write a lot of code. With CakePHP, you can build featured-packed, visually appealing results in less time. It is featured with a scalable and robust database access layer that makes developing the applications easier, simpler and fun.\nWhy should you consider CakePHP for web development?\nIt offers a wide variety of APIs that can be used to build an amazing and powerful application in a short span of time.\n2. Its installation is simple. You just need an HTTP server and some specific PHP extensions.\n3. It offers various built-in security tools, such as SQL injection, XSS protection, CSRF protection and more. Also, its codebase is inspected by Mozilla Secure Open source Program, making it a perfect choice for building highly secure web applications.\n4. It is a trustworthy framework that has a huge community, including Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc., and a robust support system.\nLatest release:CakePHP 3.8\n5. Zend Framework\nZend Framework is a composition of PHP packages that are used to develop web applications. It has more than 480 million installations to date. Industry leaders including Microsoft, Google and Strikelron have collaborated with Zend to provide the web services interface.\nBeing a completely object-oriented framework, it uses features like inheritance, offering reusability and flexibility. Here is a quick description of the object-oriented framework and its feature, inheritance.\nObject-oriented framework – It is an integrated set of components, consisting of objects and classes that have a specific structure and functionality. In layman terms, objects and classes are the set of data comprised of code, in the form of variables, integers, functions, etc.\nOver traditional methodology, the object-oriented framework offers the following benefits:\nImproved application development productivity and faster application development because of its three factors: reusability, extendibility, and modularity.\n2. Improved software maintainability and low cost of development.\nInheritance\nIt is a mechanism of object-oriented programming where one module can inherit the property of another module, sharing the same methods and attributes in the code. Hence, it offers reusability within the code.\nWhy should you consider the Zend framework for web development?\nZend framework offers a high-performance tuning for every type of application, from simple to complex enterprise-level projects.\n2. It is built with high-security practices Advanced Encryption Standard and bcrypt. It is suitable if your application requires rigorous security.\n3. Zend framework had a large community base. It has a robust support services team that can provide their expert consultant to your team in order to help you in accelerating the application development cycle.\n4. It comes with well-explained documentation that can lower the learning curve for the developers.\nLatest release: Zend framework 3\n6. Yii\nYii is an acronym for Yes It Is!. Yii is a secure, fast, simple, high performing and efficient PHP framework used for developing modern web applications. Yii is a general-purpose web framework, meaning it can be used to develop every type of web application. Its sophisticated caching support and component-based architecture enable you to build large-scale applications including e-commerce projects, content management systems (CMS), forums, portals and more.\nWhy should you consider the Yii framework for web development?\nLike other PHP frameworks, Yii is also based on MVC architecture. MVC architecture offers the following benefits:\nFaster web application development.\nSuitable for developing large-scale complex applications.\nMinor changes in the application do not affect the entire application.\nMore organized code.\nIt is extremely high-performing, customizable and extensible framework. You can customize every bit of core code easily.\nIt is a full-stack framework (meaning the framework can be used for both front-end and back-end development of the application) that provides many ready-to-use features (including multi-tier caching support, RESTful API development supportquery builders, NoSQL databases and more\nLatest release: Yii 2.0.27\n7. Phalcon\nPhalcon is a full-stack PHP framework that can be used to develop robust applications (including backend and frontend). It is known for its high performance and low server consumption.\nWhy should you consider the Yii framework for web development?\nPhalcon is easy to install and consumes less server and memory, therefore it can be a choice for the application that requires complex configuration.\nThe performance of Phalcon is comparatively higher than other frameworks because of its efficient memory utilization.\nSome of its key features:\nAutoloader: Automatically loads interfaces and classes in the code. This prevents the developer from writing a long list of classes at the beginning of the code in order to load the classes. Developers just need to write spl_autoload_registerfunction at the beginning of the code and their classes and interface will automatically get loaded. Have a look:\nSecurity and caching: Phalcon provides advanced encryption and caching capabilities. It enables you to build highly secure applications.\nConclusion:\nEach PHP framework has its own pros and cons. And they all vary in terms of documentation, community, service, database, etc. You should weigh their strengths and weaknesses carefully before choosing the right framework for your application. Here are some tips to choose the right PHP framework:\nUnderstand the requirement of your application that you want to develop.\n2. Before selecting the framework, analyze each framework on the basis of how it scales, ease of use, security, documentation, services, and more. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

    "extractedText": "Rest vs. Soap\nIan J.H Reynolds\nExplore Ian J.H Reynolds' expertise in finance and economics through his insightful articles on market trends, investment strategies, and economic analysis.\nMore posts by Ian J.H Reynolds.\nIAN J.H REYNOLDS\n6 AUG 2020 • 6 MIN READ\nOne of the common questions we get from product folks is what the difference is between rest and soap in layman's terms. There are a whole host of technologies that support the online services that we use every day. Web APIs are an integral part of the online ecosystem. The API or application programming interface can be for a web browser or a web server. When developers write code for the web, they need to choose the Web API that suits the requirements of their project.\nThere are several different types of Web APIs. They allow two applications to interact with each other through a set of rules. Developers can use these APIs to add specific functionality to their apps without having to write all of the code from scratch.\nSoap and Rest are among the most popular Web APIs. They're widely used by developers for their convenience and functionality. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages.\nWhat is Rest?\nRepresentational state transfer or Rest was developed to work with components like media, files or objects on a hardware device. Roy Fielding introduced and defined this term in his doctoral dissertation back in 2000. The idea was to detail how a well-designed web application would behave. Web services that are defined on the principles of Rest and therefore called RestFul web services.\nA resource is the key abstraction of information in Rest. Any information that can be given a name can function as a resource. It can be a collection of other resources, a document, an image, etc.\nIt uses a resource identifier to identify the particular resource that's required in an interaction between components. When HTTP is used in a transition, as it most commonly is, the GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, CONNECT, OPTIONS and TRACE operations are available. This typical use of HTTP means that developers don't need to install any extra software or libraries when they create a Rest API.\nAdvantages\nGreater flexibility\nThis is perhaps one of the biggest advantages of a Rest API. The greater data flexibility is made possible because data is not tied to any resources or methods. Rest is thus able to work with different types of calls and return different data formats. It can even change structurally with accurate implementation of hypermedia.\nBetter scalability\nMany developers also choose to utilize the Rest API because of its scalability potential. This is made possible by the separation between the client and server. Rest operates on the concept that the client and server should be separate so that they can evolve on their own. This allows the development team to scale the product with relative ease.\nRest APIs are stateless\nTheir stateless nature makes Rest APIs unique. Stateless in this respect means that none of the previous requests or responses are saved by the server. Every message is isolated so it's necessary for all of the data to be sent with the request. This makes every request more understandable and purposeful.\nUniform Interface\nThis is another big advantage of the Rest API. Developers use the same standards and that means every API has the same uniform interface. The Rest API from one application can thus communicate in exactly the same manner with a completely different application, allowing for more efficient communication.\nDisadvantages\nBound by constraints\nRest APIs are by and large bound by six architectural constraints which include the uniform interface, the client-server based nature, stateless operations, layered system architecture, etc. It’s important to understand that these constraints exist before building out your API.\nLearning curve for new developers\nIt’s not exactly beginner friendly. Developers who aren't highly skilled might find themselves going through a steep learning curve when developing a Rest API. If they don't understand the limits of this web technology they could end up in situations where they get frustrated with its limitations.\nLacks security\nUnlike other Web APIs, Rest doesn't impose any security protocols. This means that it's not the ideal technology if the service requires confidential data to be passed between the client and server. On the other hand, it's better suited to publicly available services.\nLimited transfer protocol support\nOther Web APIs like SOAP have support for a variety of different transfer protocols, including but not limited to HTTP, SMTP, UDP, and more. This puts Rest at a disadvantage since it only has support for the HTTP transfer protocol.\nWhat is Soap?\nSOAP or the Simple Object Access Protocol is a messaging protocol that allows for distributed elements of an application to communicate. This protocol can be carried over multiple transfer methods like HTTP and SMTP. Its data structure is based on XML and since it's largely human readable, it makes it easier to understand a SOAP message.\nSOAP is a concrete protocol with its own set of rules and security features like integrated ACID compliance and authorization. It's also highly complex since it requires more bandwidth and resources. It performs well in distributed enterprise environments since it doesn't assume direct point-to-point communication.\nAdvantages\nHighly secure\nSOAP APIs are used for enterprise-level web services that require enhanced security. Some of the most common APIs that use SOAP include those for payment gateways, financial services, CRM software, and more.\nLegacy system support\nSOAP is also highly preferred because of its support for legacy systems. Services that have been around for a while might have users that continue to utilize their services through the API. This ensures that users with legacy systems can continue to have access.\nSupports stateful operations\nSOAP APIs are stateless by default but the great thing about SOAP is that it has support for stateful operations as well. This can be implemented with Web Services Specifications built on top of the XML standards. It's useful for scenarios where a chain of operations has to be made, such as bank transfers.\nBuilt-in error handling\nBuilt-in error handling is a big advantage because if there's a problem with a request, the response will have the error information that can be used to fix the problem. This eliminates the guesswork from finding out exactly what went wrong.\nDisadvantages\nHighly complex\nIn comparison to Rest, SOAP is significantly more complex. It's also less flexible. This might present a challenge for developers that are not highly skilled. The extensive processing required may also slow down performance.\nNo variety of data formats\nSOAP is also extremely limited in its support of data formats. The formats supported by Rest include HTML, JSON, YAML, XML and others. Meanwhile, SOAP only supports XML.\nAPI calls are not cached\nThe process where a request is sent after an API is set up with the correct endpoints is referred to as an API call. The process results in the information being transferred, processed and feedback being provided. It's not possible for SOAP API calls to be cached.\nUses more bandwidth\nSOAP is generally slower in comparison to Rest and it also uses more bandwidth given its very complex nature. It’s another limiting factor in the efficacy of this technology for certain projects.\nWhich is better?\nMost experts have reached a consensus that Rest should be the preferred platform unless there's a good enough reason to use SOAP instead. However, it can't be ignored that there are very specific use cases in which SOAP would be the obvious choice.\nSOAP is an excellent solution for situations where Res can't be used, particularly if stateful operations need to be processed. A SOAP API makes it possible to have a chain of operations in a single transaction. Something that’s not going to be possible with a Rest API.\nThose looking to build out enterprise-level web services will naturally prefer SOAP owing to its advanced security measures. PayPal's public API is one of the prime examples of a SOAP API.\nThis API enables PayPal users to accept payments through PayPal and credit cards, add a PayPal button to their own websites and ecommerce stores, in addition to logging in with PayPal.\nThese days, most developers that build public APIs opt for Rest given the increasing popularity of this technology. All of the big social media services provide Rest APIs, allowing developers to easily integrate their apps with the platform.\nTwitter's public API is one such example. It serves a variety of purposes like enabling users to find historical tweets, an ad API for managing advertisements and a Direct Message API to send personal messages to users.\nSOAP and Rest have their strengths and weaknesses. Just how better one is compared to the other largely depends on an organization's needs. They will need to pick the API that makes the most sense for their specific use case. Generally, organizations that need to offer public APIs are going to use Rest because of the advantages that have been discussed in this post.\nRest is also preferred for most new APIs because the development work is relatively simple and it also consumes less bandwidth. It's easier to understand for developers which makes the initial implementation of APIs fairly simple. Those that need confidential data to be transferred over the API will prefer SOAP given its enhanced security. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

MEAN is an acronym for the JavaScript-based technologies used in MEAN stack development. M is for MongoDB, E is for Express JS, A is for Angular JS, and N is for Node.js. These four powerhouse technologies come together to create a fullstack javascript framework used to simply and quickly develop web applications.\nSome find the MEAN stack to be worth its weight in gold, as its applications can be written in one language for both client side and server side environments. Others however suggest that this particular grouping of technologies is no more effective than any other pithy acronyms created by devs such as, RACE (React AWS Co ElasticSearch) or, my personal favorite, JERK (jQuery Erlang Redis Kafka). In any case, it’s highly important to analyze which technologies will be best for YOUR product, not just what’s trendy. If this particular conglomeration [MEAN] makes sense for what you’re developing, then by all means (ha ha), read on.\nWith JavaScript as the common denominator for the four technologies in the MEAN stack, it’s significant features can be blanketed across any code. Switching between client and server code becomes easier with the MEAN stack as JavaScript is used in both the browser and on the server. InfoWorld gives its opinion on the efficiency provided by the MEAN stack, “MongoDB offers a more flexible, accommodating layer for storing data. Node.js provides a better nexus for running your server, while Express.js helps standardize how you build your websites. On the client, AngularJS provides a clean way of adding interactive functions and AJAX-driven rich components.” Another key benefit of this technology is that MEAN is platform independent and plays nicely with both Linux and Windows operating systems.\nA Neat Web Development Process\nArguably the greatest benefit of working with the MEAN stack is that all code is written in JavaScript, thus companies mitigate the need to hire different specialists to work on a single project. The Node.js aspect of MEAN stack web apps utilize web sockets to allow data to be sent to the client without the client side needing to request it. Obviously, this makes it an exemplary option for real-time web apps. By utilizing SPAs (single-page applications), web pages need not be refreshed for each server request, unlike most traditional web apps. Finally, each technology in the MEAN stack is free and open-source. The broad community of MEAN developers (MEANies), contributes to new developments and version upgrades of the software.\nThe Top 5 Coolest MEAN Stack Web Apps\nHers is a compilation of apps built using MEAN stack technology. From the Fandango owned social movie site to a location intelligence platform, there is no shortage of innovative apps built with the MEAN stack.

Please tell us more about Digiperform’s founding story and how you have built it up to where it is today?\nDigiperform is India’s leading digital skill development network. Our vision is to create highly skilled manpower to support the digital economy in India by creating in-demand, job role-specific curriculum, certification, and processes delivered through the network of our education partners, enabled with training and marketing technology.\nIn the past 5 years, we have trained about 20000 individuals across 12 states and 16 cities. Currently, we have 40 classroom centers operating in India, having state-of-the-art learning infrastructure to support digital skills.\nThe idea of Digiperform was born in Dec 2013 when me (Vaibhav Vats) and my co-founder, Manujolly, were working together on various projects for our digital marketing agency, Mobiz Digital.\nWhile brainstorming, we realized that there would be an utter need of skilled digital marketers if businesses wanted to survive in this competitive digital world.\nWith my expertise in digital training and Manu’s entrepreneurial skills, we came to the inference that the market would need to overcome the requirement of skilled manpower through conceptualized training systems.\nThereafter, we decided to open our own chain of Digital Marketing Institutes all over the country to bridge out the gap between the market requirements and skilled digital marketers.\nAbout Us:\nManujolly, a serial entrepreneur, began his career by accomplishing many ventures like Complanet, KNM Services Private Limited and went on to become India-Head – Banking and Finance Services at Hinduja Global Solutions Ltd. He conceptualized the idea of a digital marketing agency, Mobiz Digital and later co-founded Digiperform.\nVaibhav Vats is a technology graduate with consulting background and one of the pioneers in digital marketing training industry in India. He has been consulting to various digital marketing agencies, US IT firms and Indian political parties on leveraging their digital presence.\n2. What are your plans for this capital raised, and how have you been achieving your goals?\nVaibhav: First, it feels awesome to be in the league of Mult-Million Dollar Companies. We have been all focussed and set to penetrate into different geo. As we are already in 12 states; we are planning to make a mark in 2 more cities by the end of April.\nOur motive is to cover up all the states in India to bring out the best talents of this country. We are planning to cover up every state and every district in India. With same determination, we are working closely with big internet aka Tech Giants to achieve this which you will soon see in our coming-up BIG Announcements. (Vaibhav winked)\n3. How does Digital Marketing Industry specific ecosystem looking like at the moment and how does this compare to a few years ago?\nVaibhav: It’s Lit :D.\nInternet usage has increased big time since last 10 years and the consumers are now more aware of online resources. They are becoming tech-savvy which has led more companies to adopt digital strategies. Even Non-metros are not lacking behind and equally competing with the metro’s today. You can find that there is a drastic change in the buying trends as well. Consumer prefers to buy products or services over online platforms rather than going out and struggling.\nEven companies are making most of it. For example, Amazon is delivering to Ladakh via. air a place which is cut in winters via. roads. So it’s definitely amazing. The time will come when businesses won’t be able to breathe without digital marketing.\n4. What are the biggest challenges facing the Digital Marketing Industry and what do you think it will look like in 5 years’ time?\nVaibhav: SME’s adopting digital platforms. The biggest challenge lies today that 63% are still not online, out of all online only 20% have a substantial presence. Also, Local skilled manpower is not available to support the transformation as agencies are very expensive.\nTo bridge out the requirement, we are working on the same lines to reach to every district and create local digitally skilled manpower to support local businesses.\nOnce there will be local support to these SME’s, they will feel more confident to grow and rise above the competition. With the pace we are growing digitally, the time will come when there will be more 80% transformed SME’s who will be using online platforms to sell their products and competing at international levels.\n5. What is the biggest lesson you have learned as a founder?\nVaibhav: One should Adapt and stay Updated. Digital Marketing industry is changing every day; rather twice a day. If you want to go along with the trend and current requirement, you have to constantly adapt these changes. For businesses, feedbacks, operations and sheer visibility of the end users are very important and helpful to understand the current scenario.\n6. What’s the most important thing you’re working on right now, and how are you making it happen?\nVaibhav: As I have already shared we are reaching out to every district, village, town, and city in the country and have been partnered with few of the biggest names in the digital industry to create local digitally skilled manpower. This path will not only help businesses to avail digitally skilled manpower; it will help job seekers as well as freshers to work on their career and be the part of the most happening industry of this millennium.\n7. Take me through the skills of your top team members. What is each person best at?\nEach individual in our team has the best skill sets and help Digiperform to accomplish its goals. We can’t pin out the single candidate to address the best. We have the qualified and experienced members in our team who work with a go-getter attitude. I am very thankful to my whole team and sharing details of few won’t justify everyone’s efforts and hard work, given to us.\n8. What’s the hardest decision you’ve made so far?\nVaibhav: Staying true to this business. It’s tough for people to accept it. People always think digital marketing training is a bubble, they do not understand that a $1 trillion digital economy will require a mammoth effort.\n9. What does culture mean to you and how do you ensure this culture is maintained with everyone at the company?\nVaibhav: Being transparent and not over-committing. We have a flat organization with no hierarchies. Everyone knows what they are committing to and to whom and they have to own the outcome. So whether this commitment is to our end-users to our partners we try to stick to our culture.\n10. How do you drive innovation and new product cycles?\nVaibhav: Regular Feedback is the ideal key to understand the success of your product. We have a constant system where we get feedback of everything whether it’s Advertising, Sales, Delivery, Recruiters hiring our trainees and market sentiment. This helps us to refine the things that can dismantle our goal.\n11. What does your typical day look like?\nVaibhav: As we are still a startup and we do keep on getting unplanned situations. Hence, there is not a major structuring I’ve done, to my day. I simply have weekly goals and try to achieve them in the best possible way.\n12. What are some industry trends that are driving the company’s strategies for future growth?\nVaibhav: Increasing Internet usage and acceptance of Digital Marketing pan India are driving the companies strategies for future growth. Internet users are expected to rapidly rise and reach 627 million by the end of 2019 covering up all the rural areas. It will increase the number of online buying as well as information sharing footfall; ultimately which will create the need to accept and adopt Digital Marketing Strategies to run businesses.\n13. What is the company’s competitive advantage? Why will it be sustained?\nVaibhav: Creating localized digital skilled talent for local businesses is the biggest advantage. Local businesses need local support, and we are here to create as well as nurture that supports them.\nThe market is huge and I don’t see any reason why we won’t be able to sustain this. We are going to win this. ?\n14. What do you do when you’re not at work?\nVaibhav: Travel, Eat, & Create better Educational Product.

This Privacy Policy describes how we may collect and use your personal information\nInformation We Collect\nPersonal information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, email address, a home, postal or other physical address, other contact information, title, occupation, industry, personal interests, and other information when needed to provide a service or product or carry out a transaction you have requested. Unless you choose to voluntarily provide the information to us, we do not collect personally identifiable information about you, such as your name, address, telephone number, fax number, or e-mail address. For instance, you may be asked to provide us with your personal information when you apply for a job opening, register to attend a company event, or wish to subscribe to a newsletter. If you elect to submit any personal information, your submission is subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you consent to such terms.\nLike many other commercial websites, the Zibtek website may use standard technologies, such as “cookies“ and other HTML tools, to collect information about how you use the site or to record that you opened an email marketing message. As such, we may log your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) to give us an idea of which part of our website you visit and how long you spend there. See section entitled “Cookies“ below.\nCookies\nSome parts of the Zibtek website use cookies to track user traffic patterns. We do this in order to determine the usefulness of our website information to our users and to see how effective our navigational structure is in helping users reach that information. A cookie is a small data file that certain web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you have visited.\nIf you prefer not to receive cookies while browsing our website, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in your browser, although you may not be able to take full advantage of the Zibtek website if you do so. In particular, you may be required to accept cookies in order to complete certain actions on our website. You do not need to have cookies turned on, however, to use/navigate through many parts of our website, except access to certain of Zibtek's web pages that require a login and password.\nNotice\nWhen personal information is collected, we will inform you at the point of collection the purpose for the collection. Zibtek will not transfer your personal information to third parties without your consent, except under the limited conditions described under the section entitled “Information Sharing and Disclosure“ below.\nIn most cases we will provide you with the opportunity to “opt in“ prior to receiving direct marketing or market research information. This means we will require your affirmative action to indicate your consent before we use your information for purposes other than the purpose for which it was submitted. At a minimum, we will always give you the opportunity to “opt out“ of receiving such materials. This means we assume you have given us your consent to collect and use your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy unless you take affirmative action to indicate that you do not consent, for instance by clicking or checking the appropriate option or box at the point of collection.\nHow We Use Information Collected\nZibtek uses personal information for several general purposes: to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, to personalize your experience on our website, to keep you up to date on the latest product announcements, software updates, special offers or other information we think you would like to hear about either from us or from our business partners, and to better understand your needs and provide you with better services. We may also use your information to send you, or to have our business partners send you, direct marketing information or contact you for market research.\nInformation Sharing and Disclosure\nWe do not transfer or share your information except as provided below:\nBecause Zibtek is a global company, your personal information may be transferred or shared with other Zibtek offices or subsidiaries around the world. This may result in your information crossing from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. All such entities are governed by this Privacy Policy.\nZibtek may also share your information to third parties if we collect your information for a specific purpose (e.g., to register you for an event or register for the newsletter) and such third party must receive your information for registration purposes (e.g., third party operates the newsletter).\nZibtek may also share your information with our business partners in those cases where we believe that your business might be served and we can better provide you with updates on services and benefits provided by us and our business partners.\nZibtek may also send your personal information to other companies or people if:\no * we have your consent to share the information; or\no * if required to do so by law, or if we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a court order or subpoena, to cooperate with investigations by law enforcement or regulatory authorities or to participate or cooperate with a judicial proceeding, or in urgent circumstances, to protect personal safety, the public or our websites;\nIn the event of a merger, consolidation or reorganization involving Zibtek, acquisition of Zibtek by another company, a sale of all or a portion of Zibtek's assets, or other similar transaction, your personal information will, in most instances, be transferred to the control of the third party that is part of that transaction.\nData Security\nZibtek and its companies are committed to protecting your personal information and do so with certain physical and technological procedures. However, we cannot ensure the security of the information as you transmit it to us, and so we urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet.

If we make any substantial changes in the way, we use your personal information we will make that information available by posting a notice on this site. We may also, but are not required to, notify you by email or regular mail.\nThis Privacy Policy was last updated April 17, 2024.\nText a question\nBy continuing to use this site, you agree to our cookie policy and privacy policy.\nGot it"

    "extractedText": "SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT\nBest way to kick off a new software project\nIan J.H Reynolds\nExplore Ian J.H Reynolds' expertise in finance and economics through his insightful articles on market trends, investment strategies, and economic analysis.\nMore posts by Ian J.H Reynolds.\nIAN J.H REYNOLDS\n29 SEP 2020 • 4 MIN READ\nSo, you are sitting in your office and have an idea for great new tool that could help your company drive efficiency. Now what? Even experienced product owners understand that launching a new software project can be riddled with challenges. As I guy who has sold tons of software projects and seen many fall flat, let me share with you the recipe that has led to our most successful engagements.\nThe Project Kickoff Meeting\nOften clients come to us with nothing more than an idea. We prepare them with the kickoff meeting. Our client services team at Zitbek has to work with that client to extract the idea from our clients minds and convert it to features and functionality. Here is a list of the questions we ask:\n· What is the core problem you are trying to solve?\n· Are there similar applications in the market today?\n· What do they specifically lack and why?\n· Is it a web or mobile app?\n· How many different types of users / people will be using this application?\nAfter gaining a sense of the spirit of the application, the team at Zibtek works towards mapping out the flow of the application. Here is an example of what that looks like:\nCheapest way to ideate is in design.\nOften the creation of the UI/UX is where to software starts to become real. Oftentimes with new projects the initial design session is where they real think their application. Visually seeing how users are going to use their tool to solve problems creates an environment that challenges their idea and encourages the new product owner to think through even the smallest of details.\nIt all starts with the user journey. Let’s say that were creating Uber. Well we would identify that there are going to be at least 3 types of users. Passengers, Drivers and Uber. At Zibtek we start with one of these users like Passengers for example. The designer would sit with the client and flush out everything a passenger would need to see or click in order to get a ride. Once that process is finished, you repeat with the Driver and Uber roles. One of the most often forgotten portions of application development is creating that admin role. It is critical to almost all functionality of an application especially monetization! The compellation of all of these efforts is displayed as a Wire Frame.\nIt’s all about the planning.\nAfter the designs are finalized, it can seem like the most of the work is done. Unfortunately, the work has just begun. For engineers to truly understand how to build your application the way you have visualized is to put together a planning strategy or document in a tool like Clickup. Clickup allows project managers to breakdown core functionality in to bite sizes pieces. These pieces are usually referred to as tickets. Each ticket / functionality has to be planned by 1st defining the user story.\nDefine User Stories\n· I – Independent\n· N – Negotiable\n· V – Valuable\n· E – Estimable\n· S – Small\n· T – Testable\nOnce user stories have been written, acceptance criteria (AC) for each of those user stories must be established. AC’s are critical because they are used to make the decision is a feature is complete. Defining success is often lost on many projects and why scope creep is a popular term.\nOne the most critical part of the planning process is determining the most effective tech stack. Probably one of the biggest differences between Zibtek in other development companies is that we have a “Product First” initiative. Zibtek believes in selecting the best technology for the problem, not selecting the technology we have the most experience in like other firms.\nCommunication is key in principle engineering.\nThe costliest part of the software building process is principle engineering. Which means it is the part as a client you want to be as close to as possible. The difference between a successful build and an expensive never-ending project is usually directly linked to how responsive the client is during the engineering process.\nThe software build uses an Agile approach in which is work is broken down in to 2 weeks sprints. These sprints are utilized to create a measuring stick for progress. Evaluating the amount of productivity that happens in a 2-week period greatly helps in planning out an entire build. This model combined with continuous delivery (Continuous delivery pipeline is an implementation of the continuous paradigm, where automated builds, tests and deployments are orchestrated as one release workflow) allows Zibtek to get our clients functioning code as quickly as possible so they can provide feedback and test.\nClient communication during the sprint process is necessary as engineering priorities can often change as work proves out to be easier or more complicated then originally estimated. Decisions need to be made in order to keep the team productive.\nDefine Success.\nOne of the biggest contributors to scope creep is a moving goal post. If the target constantly changes, it will never get hit.\nProper planning and communications provide the environment needed to define success in aver specific way. That definition will set clear expectations for both the engineers and the product owners. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

    "extractedText": "PRACTICAL AGILE\nRestoring the Proportion of the Agile Software Development\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n18 JAN 2021 • 8 MIN READ\nAfter 25 years of experience, 3 acquisitions, and over 300 products, we have decided to share some of the knowledge we have gained from working in this industry.\nAgile Software Development\nThe software development industry is accelerating at a rapid pace, therefore we thought it would be beneficial to provide not just one blog post about agile software development, but a whole series regarding a practical approach to the agile method and how our company has benefited from implementing these agile practices. From Zibtek to your company, we hope you can take away something valuable from this new blog post series that will help you have success in your endeavors. If you have any questions concerning any information in these posts, please feel free to reach out to us.\nWhen was the Agile Manifesto developed?\nIn 2001, a group of 17 men gathered together in Snowbird Utah to ski, talk, and discuss the future of software development. From this meeting, the Agile Manifesto emerged, thus implementing this style of development across the world. The message is short, simple, and emphasizes the importance of valuing human connection in the industry. The manifesto encompasses these four main points:\nIndividuals and interactions over processes and tools\nWorking software over comprehensive documentation\nCustomer collaboration over contract negotiation\nResponding to change over following a plan\nThe Problems in Agile Style of Software Development\nAs the agile style of software development has become popular in the past 20 years, the method has evolved into an extreme. It seems that companies are replacing the word “over” with “instead of” in the manifesto. For example, some businesses are approaching the agile method as valuing individuals and interactions instead of processes and tools or responding to change instead of following a plan. While individual interaction and responding to change is vital, these ideas can’t replace what creates structure in the company.\nLike in all elements of life, actions need to be performed in moderation. The Agile method of software development has been taken to an extreme that has created a negative context associated with the word. In the manifesto, underneath the “History” tab it states, “The Agile movement is not anti-methodology, in fact, many of us want to restore credibility to the word methodology. We want to restore a balance.” The keyword in this statement is “balance”. The purpose of this agile style of software development was never meant to be a replacement of focus, but a re-emphasis of methods.\nAgile Manifesto for Software Development\nThe “Rename”\nAt Zibtek, we have strived to restore balance to the use of the agile method. To emphasize this change, we often describe our process as “practical agile”. We strongly and genuinely implement the human connection that is highlighted in the manifesto, but on the other hand, we value efficiency and productivity, therefore we haven’t eliminated processes, tools, and documentation. Through “practical agile” we have introduced a balance that promotes the results that ultimately the agile method was designed to produce back in 2001.\nAgile Software Development\nAgile Software Development Methods\nThrough this series of blog posts, we will describe how Zibtek implements a “practical agile” method of software development in our process as well as the results that have derived from this shift. If you have any questions regarding our software development services or how we utilize a \"practical agile\" method within our company feel free to reach out to us.\nMore posts from Practical Agile series:\nTeam Building: When and How to Split a Dev Team\nWhen is the Best Time To Split My Team?

    "extractedText": "What are the benefits of staff augmentation?\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n7 MAY 2025 • 6 MIN READ\nImagine this: You're two weeks away from a major product launch. Your internal team is stretched thin, your roadmap includes a critical cloud-native microservices integration and an advanced security audit, and there’s simply no time to recruit, onboard, and train new hires from scratch. Traditional hiring timelines—often measured in months—threaten your go-live date. Meanwhile, generic consulting engagements can deliver recommendations but leave execution gaps.\nEnter Zibtek’s staff augmentation—a flexible, on-demand model that embeds pre-vetted experts directly into your team to close skill gaps, accelerate delivery, and control costs without long-term commitments.\nStaff Augmentation Meaning and Models\nWhat Is Staff Augmentation?\nStaff augmentation is the strategic practice of supplementing your internal workforce with external professionals or contractors for defined periods and projects. The primary goal is to fill precise skill gaps—whether in software development, cybersecurity, or data science—without altering your organizational hierarchy or making permanent hires.\nThis model allows companies to swiftly scale their capacity up or down, matching resource levels to project demands and avoiding the delays of traditional recruitment cycles.\nGlobally, the staffing industry—which underpins much of the staff augmentation market—is estimated to support nearly $650 billion in annual spend, reflecting the widespread adoption of contingent talent models across sectors.\nStaff Augmentation Meaning\nOften abbreviated as staff aug, this approach stands apart from full outsourcing by preserving internal management control. Augmented professionals report directly to your project leads, use your tools and methodologies, and integrate into your team culture—ensuring cohesion and consistency.\nUnlike purely “plug-and-play” outsourced teams, staff aug specialists function as extensions of your in-house staff: they attend stand-ups, participate in sprint planning, and adhere to your performance metrics .\nThis hands-on integration minimizes communication friction and accelerates time to productivity, typically allowing experts to contribute meaningfully within one to two weeks of engagement.\nStaff Augmentation vs Consulting\nWhere consulting engagements primarily provide strategic recommendations, staff augmentation delivers both strategy and execution. Consultants diagnose challenges, develop roadmaps, and often hand off plans, whereas augmented professionals embed in your sprint cycles to implement solutions directly.\nConsulting fees can be high, and project success may hinge on client-side execution; staff augmentation aligns cost-per-hour rates with deliverables, reducing the risk of “analysis paralysis” and ensuring accountability for implementation.\nMoreover, mixing consulting and augmentation can yield synergistic outcomes: consultants set the vision, and augmented teams bring it to life under a unified governance model.\nIT Staff Augmentation Companies\nThe marketplace for staff augmentation companies includes generalist platforms (Upwork Enterprise, Toptal) and specialized firms (Zibtek, Modis, Accenture). Leading providers differentiate on three core dimensions:\nVetting Rigor: Top firms conduct multi-stage interviews, live coding assessments, and reference checks to ensure technical mastery.\nTime-to-Match: Premier companies maintain talent pools that enable 1–2 week turnaround from request to candidate start date.\nDomain Focus: Firms with vertical expertise (fintech, healthcare, retail) offer specialists familiar with industry regulations, compliance standards, and best practices.\nZibtek’s end-to-end process exemplifies these standards—combining automated skill assessments, cultural alignment interviews, and continuous performance reviews to achieve a 95% first-match success rate.\nKey Benefits of Staff Augmentation\n1. Instant Access to Specialized Talent\nWith staff augmentation, Zibtek clients tap into a curated global network of senior engineers, DevOps specialists, cybersecurity architects, data scientists, and more—professionals who start delivering value within days, not months. Unlike traditional consulting, where consultants advise but do not execute, our experts integrate into your existing workflows, attend daily stand-ups, write code in your repositories, and follow your sprint cadence.\n2. Cost Efficiency and Predictable Budgeting\nEngaging talent through staff augmentation companies eliminates the hidden costs of full-time hires—salaries, benefits, equipment, recruitment fees, and office overhead. Zibtek customers report up to 85% cost savings compared to permanent staffing models, aligning with Deloitte’s finding that 47% of small businesses realize significant budget reductions by leveraging contingent experts.\n3. Scalability and On-Demand Flexibility\nBusiness needs ebb and flow. Whether you require a single specialist for a proof-of-concept or a 10-member team for a full product sprint, staff aug scales up or down with zero friction. Gartner notes that 65% of organizations rank flexibility as their top driver for adopting staff augmentation, enabling rapid pivots and efficient resource utilization.\n4. Accelerated Time to Market\nBy bypassing protracted recruiting and onboarding, Zibtek’s augmented teams often cut project delivery timelines by 38%, according to PwC’s research comparing augmentation to traditional hires. Forrester further reports that companies leveraging staff augmentation strategies bring products to market 20% faster than peers relying solely on in-house teams.\n5. Enhanced Risk Mitigation and Quality Assurance\nAugmented professionals arrive with domain-specific best practices, compliance certifications, and proven methodologies. In regulated industries—healthcare, finance, defense—this reduces audit failures and rework. Zibtek specialists hold industry certifications (CISSP, AWS/GCP/Azure Professional, PMP) and adhere to rigorous code-review processes, slashing defect rates by up to 50% in client engagements.\nTraditional Hiring vs. Staff Augmentation: A Simple Timeline\nWhen to Leverage Staff Augmentation\nShort-Term, High-Skill Projects\nStaff augmentation is perfect for short-term initiatives requiring niche expertise unavailable internally. Whether migrating legacy systems to the cloud, prototyping blockchain smart contracts in Solidity or Rust, or launching a Swift or Kotlin mobile feature, you get specialists who hit the ground running. This approach avoids lengthy recruitment cycles while ensuring you meet aggressive deadlines with confidence.\nSeasonal or Cyclical Workloads\nDuring peak seasons—like holiday e-commerce surges or end-of-quarter close-outs—you can onboard QA testers, database engineers, or support agents without the commitment of full-time hires. When demand subsides, simply scale back to your core team, avoiding underutilized staff and ongoing overhead. The same model works for fixed-term, grant-funded research, keeping operations lean yet fully resourced.\nRapid Market Pivots\nWhen regulations change or new technologies emerge, staff augmentation lets you integrate specialists—GDPR/CCPA experts, edge-computing engineers, or IoT developers—within days. These professionals help you prototype, validate, and comply swiftly, maintaining momentum. By leveraging this flexible strategy, you stay ahead of competitors without the drag of traditional hiring. Scaling In-House Teams\nAlleviate burnout and prevent attrition by adding experts during crunch times.\nBy embedding elite talent exactly when and where you need it, Zibtek’s staff augmentation offering empowers your organization to maintain project momentum, reduce costs, and de-risk critical initiatives—without the delays or overhead of traditional hiring. Whether you’re facing a looming deadline, embarking on a strategic pivot, or scaling for seasonal demand, staff augmentation delivers an agile, cost-effective solution.\nDrive Growth with On-Demand Staff Augmentation\nRather than being held back by hiring delays or stretched resources, imagine having the precise skills you need arrive exactly when you need them—no guesswork, no overhead. Zibtek’s staff augmentation model delivers this promise, combining cost efficiency, specialized expertise, and operational agility to power projects of any scope—from short-term, high-impact initiatives to seasonal surges and strategic pivots. By embedding pre-vetted professionals directly into your workflows, you retain full managerial control, preserve cultural cohesion, and accelerate your path to value. Whether you’re executing a complex cloud migration, scaling for peak demand, or navigating new regulatory landscapes, Zibtek equips you to tackle every challenge with confidence. Ready to transform your team and future-proof your operations? Contact Zibtek today to explore tailored staff augmentation solutions that drive sustainable growth.\nHow does staff augmentation differ from managed services?\nManaged services outsource entire operational domains—support desks, network ops—while staff augmentation embeds specialists into your existing teams under your governance.\nWhat criteria should I use to select an IT staff augmentation partner?\nAssess candidate vetting speed, technical assessment rigor, cultural alignment processes, and ongoing performance management—Zibtek’s 95% first-match rate and biweekly feedback loops set us apart. Can staff augmentation support agile methodologies?\nAbsolutely—augmented professionals join your Scrum or Kanban rituals, contribute to sprint planning, and deliver backlog items incrementally, fitting seamlessly into Agile frameworks.

Zinch provides high school students with the resources they need to get into the college of their dreams by connecting them with college recruiters. Zinch worked with several teams both internally and using offshore developers to get its product built. Unfortunately, these teams were not hitting the mark.\nChallenge\nAs a startup, Zinch knew that hiring the right talent was important, as custom software development tends to be expensive. Zinch tested several different channels while looking for developer talent but found none that were meeting expectations. The team tried to utilize local freelancers and engineers, but they were costly to employ for extended engagements. Zinch also tried working with other direct international developers from Ukraine and Vietnam and but had difficulty nailing down effectiveness with these outsourced teams. With investor funding and timeline dwindling, Zinch needed to get its product built quickly and done right the first time.\nGoals\nThe overall goal for Zinch was to create an online portal for students to showcase themselves to admissions officers. This would lead to connections being made and scholarships being offered.\nSolution\nHaving worked with international teams who stifled progress, Zinch knew that it needed to find the right developers to augment its team and get the product built quickly. After two weeks of Zibtek’s developer progress on the Zinch product, the team knew they had finally found the right tech partner. This new model allowing the Zinch team to communicate in clear English with a US-based tech lead was the piece that was missing in earlier partnerships.\nOutcome\nThe Zinch product gained 3.5 million users before its acquisition by Chegg. This acquisition had lead to a huge expansion for Chegg by tripling its user base, increasing scholarship amounts to $1.9 billion, and adding over 5,000 school profiles to its existing list. Because quick product iterations were made for Zinch, it was able to find the perfect product market fit. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

Numerous off the shelf ERP solutions were evaluated but no single solution covered all of the business's needs. As a result, the firm decided to hire a custom software development services firm to build a custom web based ERP solution.\nTheir marketing website was also stale and needed to be redesigned and re-launched.\nThe design of a new application and redesign of the marketing website presented several UI and UX challenges. The product catalog had to be restructured in such a way that allowed both web locations to accurately reflected available products, their features and had the flexibility to add new products.\nTo accommodate growth, the client needed a system that would help match customer orders with inventory management orders of supplies.\nVarious client billing systems needed to be integrated into the tool to allow for a seamless experience for vendors and suppliers.

    "extractedText": "Cost of Software Development? Here are 6 Factors to Consider.\nVedant Vyas\nRead more posts by this author.\nVEDANT VYAS\n5 JUL 2021 • 4 MIN READ\nThe cost of software development comes up frequently in conversation. Hundreds, if not thousands of pieces of web applications are created each month. We’ve come a long way from specialized apps being the domain of large corporations with hefty budgets. Nearly any business can now benefit from a customized app. So, what’s holding many of them back? The cost of software development is a major concern. SMBs often lack the internal resources needed to build their apps and typically can’t afford to hire in-house engineers. Many consider outsourcing software development but still experience sticker shock upon receipt of the estimate.\nLet’s take a look at what drives the cost of software development. We’ll also discuss ways you can build a workable app within your price range.\nWhat Determines the Cost of Software Development?\nCustom software can increase company-wide efficiency, increase innovation, and help you reach new customers. So, it would seem like a pretty good long-term investment. But it’s the short-term companies think about most. How much you’ll need to spend in the present often makes it difficult to see the lasting benefits.\nPlus, because every project is unique, there’s no template to follow when pricing software development. A quick online search reveals hourly engineer costs of anywhere from $30 to $150 per hour and more. Estimated costs per application range from $20,000 to $150,000. Not very helpful, right?\nWhat might be more helpful is to take a “backward approach.” That simply means taking a look at the factors involved first to see if maybe there are ways to keep your costs lower.\nSchedule\nTime is a huge factor in estimating software costs. For instance, if you have a short deadline in mind, the development company will likely need to expand resources to accommodate your time constraints. Therefore, the more flexible you can be on delivery, the more you may save.\nAnother cost-saving idea is to ask your internal team or a software consultant how long it would realistically take to build your app. You can then multiply this time by the average cost of engineers and come up with a rough idea of your total development costs. Just remember there are always non-development activities that affect the final price.\n2. Team Skills\nEvery project requires a business analyst, project manager, designers, developers, and testers. The size of a team depends on how complex the project is. What they’re paid is contingent on their experience level. If your project is complex, but you decide to hire as few people as possible to save money, you’ll likely end up paying more as the project will take much longer to complete.\n3. Scope/Product Complexity\nProject requirements are directly proportional to software costs, with every deliverable, constraint, and assumption adding to the bottom line. The more time you put into fleshing out your project’s scope, the more precise your cost estimation will be.\n4. Creative Design\nThe Apple App Store alone has nearly 2 million available apps. If your product lacks visual appeal or is difficult to understand and navigate, there’s a good chance users will scroll past it. To make your product stand out, you need the support of professional UX/UI designers. The more customized your product is, the more you’ll spend to bring it to life. One alternative is to choose a standard design with pre-built templates.\n5. Methodology\nThe methodology used is closely related to research and development expenses. A traditional waterfall approach can sound cost “safe” on paper as it methodically works its way from point A to point Z. But an agile methodology can be more cost-effective in the long run because it continuously adapts as requirements change during the development process.\n6. Third-Party Integration\nThird-party integrations like ERPs and CRMs offer multiple opportunities for businesses and users. Including them in your project can take additional time, which will affect development costs. On the other hand, these integrations can help you alter the software development cost breakdown so that instead of building unique features from scratch, you can integrate ready-made solutions into your software and cut the person-hours.\nHow to Manage the Cost of Software Development\nThere are so many variables that go into estimating the cost of software development, it’s nearly impossible to predict what investment your project will require. Some ways to manage costs and ensure coming in at or under budget include:\nClearly defining your goals ahead of time.\nUsing a continuous deployment solution like Agile that allows your app to be built, tested, and released much faster and more efficiently.\nImplementing a backlog refinement process so work can be adjusted to feedback in real-time.\nAt Zibtek, we’re committed to helping you build a custom piece of software that meets your business and budget requirements.

    "extractedText": "The 7 Lean Software Development Principles\nVedant Vyas\nRead more posts by this author.\nVEDANT VYAS\n25 JUN 2021 • 4 MIN READ\nLearning the 7 lean software development principles is vital to your success. The expression “lean and mean” is just another way of saying, “efficient and successful.” A lean approach to any endeavor means using only what’s necessary and determined to work effectively to compete successfully.\nLean build or lean software development emphasizes optimizing efficiency and minimizing waste. Pioneered by Toyota in the lean manufacturing movement of the 1980s, the approach is now considered an integral part of the Agile software development methodology.\nThe Guiding Principles of Lean Software Development\nLean software development is a set of principles that, when applied to software development, can decrease programming effort, budgeting, and defect rates, often by up to a third. It’s an innovative approach that aims to remove all things unnecessary from software engineering.\nDepending on who you talk to, there are anywhere from four to seven principles of lean software development. The customer-centric approach of each aims to quicken delivery and bring higher end-user value.\nWaste Elimination\nWe’ve talked before about the Pareto Principle, where 80 percent of effects come from 20 percent of causes. Back in 2002, Jim Johnson of the Standish Group applied the theory to software features, stating only 20 percent of software features are often used while the other 80 percent are infrequently, hardly ever, or never used. They may be features that, in theory, make the user experience better but, sad to say, if people aren’t using them, they’re of no value. Eliminating what won’t bring value to the end-user speeds the development process, removes unnecessary system complexity, and boosts team morale.\n2. Built-in Quality\nNaturally, every team wants to build quality into their work. Yet unless this principle is part of a disciplined practice, the result is often waste. In lean development, quality is not only QA’s job; it belongs to everyone. Agile tools for building in quality can include test-driven, incremental development, continuous feedback, and automation of tedious tasks.\n3. Knowledge Creation\nSoftware development is a knowledge-driven progression that encourages teams to put the right structures in place for proper learning. Simple in theory, this principle requires complete focus and commitment. It’s typically implemented through training, code reviews and comments, pair programming, sharing sessions, and more.\n4. Deferred Commitment\nMany development people instinctively make decisions as quickly as possible. As a lean principle, deferring decision-making and commitment:\nEncourages project teams to keep options open for a more extended period so they can gather more data and information for making crucial decisions.\nResults in more time to learn and gain valuable knowledge, which results in even better decisions.\nEnsures a project doesn’t suffer negative impacts from poor decision-making.\nWhen you think about it, it makes perfect sense. Isn’t it better to put off making rash decisions if the result is a product with fewer failures along the way?\n5. Fast Delivery\nThe purpose of Agile development is to deliver software as quickly as possible. Lean development ties into learning from failures and receiving feedback. The more quickly a team delivers features for user testing, the faster it can make the product better. Put another way, don’t be afraid to release an imperfect product that you can update based on customer response.\n6. Team Respect\nLean management has always focused on “people over processes.” It honors the individual and recognizes the fact that people do the real work. You can communicate respect to the team in any number of ways as long as you start with a healthy work environment that supports the lean method’s principles. Proactive communication, process improvement, and conflict resolution techniques are excellent examples of conveying team respect.\n7. See the Whole\nSome people refer to this as total optimization. Whatever you choose to call it, it’s about seeing software development as a big-picture venture that envisions the whole scope of where a project is going, who it’s going to affect, and how it can reach the widest audience.

    "extractedText": "SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT\nHow To Find Trustworthy Software Development Services\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n25 JUL 2023 • 5 MIN READ\nPoor Charlie Brown, every time he decides to put his faith in Lucy’s assurances she’ll hold the football in place, he ends up sprawled flat on his back, disillusioned and questioning his trust in others.\nWhy is it that we can all relate to this so well?\nIt’s an unfortunate fact of life that everyone gets burned by someone they’ve put their trust in. And when that someone’s a professional who you’ve paid a lot of money to, you can often feel downright scorched.\nIf you’ve previously been let down by a software development company, or your concern about being taken advantage of is holding you back from trusting one, this post’s for you. We’re going to guide you through finding a reliable partner that delivers on its assurances and prioritizes your project’s success.\nWhat Should I Research?\nIt can be awfully tempting to hand over a software development project to someone promising the moon and hoping for the best. However, educating yourself on key software-related topics and terms helps level the communication field, ensuring you make informed decisions and find a dependable partner.\nHow To Find Trustworthy Software Development Services\nProcess and methodologies. Software development methodologies include Agile, Scrum, Kanban, and Waterfall, each offering distinct advantages and approaches to project management. Understanding the basics of each helps evaluate the company's development process and determine if it aligns with your requirements.\nLanguages. Numerous programming languages exist to build different custom software and apps, including Java, JavaScript, Python, and Ruby. Familiarizing yourself with which languages are typically used for software or apps like yours, helps you assess whether a company’s well-versed in the technologies your project requires.\nSoftware development lifecycle. A software project’s lifecycle covers everything from requirements gathering and design to development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Knowing these stages gives you more confidence in being able to track your project’s progress.\nProject management principles. Setting clear goals, defining project scope, establishing timelines, and managing risks should be defining standards for any software development company worthy of your business.\nQuality assurance and testing. One of the greatest advances in software development has been the automation of testing scripts. Knowing if a company conducts testing using the latest technologies to ensure software quality can help you find a reliable partner.\nIndustry standards and best practices. Research for yourself, industry standards and best practices in software development so you’re better equipped to assess whether a company is up to speed on the latest trends and adheres to the industry’s ethical principles.\nSecurity and data protection: Learning about the latest cybersecurity and data protection measures helps determine a company's commitment to safeguarding sensitive information.\nBudgeting and costs estimation. Getting burned by a software developer often goes hand-in-hand with hiring the company that made the cheapest bid. Researching what similar successful apps and software to yours should cost can help you avoid choosing a partner based solely on the lowest cost, quality be damned.\nSpending some time on market research and competitive analysis is another good way to identify software development companies specializing in your niche. That said, keep in mind that experienced providers can typically deliver high-quality products and offer more comprehensive solutions that meet your goals and objectives, no matter your industry or sector.\nWhat Green Flags Might I Find?\nUnlike those pesky red ones we so often ignore because we want something so badly, green flags let you know a software development company is reliable, competent, and trustworthy. Rather than the typical “fake-out” delivered by the Lucy’s of the world, these will highlight the right people to hold the ball. Our favorites for identifying a promising partner include:\nProven expertise and experience. This can be verified with a strong portfolio, positive reviews, and testimonials from satisfied and repeat clients.\nStructured project management. Does the company provide regular progress updates and milestone tracking? Zibtek uses a practical agile approach to software development that ensures efficient communication and transparency throughout the project’s lifecycle, allowing clients to stay informed and confident in the development process.\nEmphasis on quality assurance. Development companies that prioritize rigorous testing and quality assurance show a commitment to delivering high-quality products.\nTransparent pricing. No software development company worth its salt will underbid a project just to get the job. Ones that offer straightforward pricing without hidden costs or fees demonstrate professionalism and integrity, earning their customers’ trust.\nPost-development support. A software project doesn’t end the moment after launch. Reliable development companies stand by their work and are ready to fix any issues that arise after the project’s completion.\nOther signs you’re on the right track include finding a company willing to explore innovative solutions to address your unique needs. And if it has a lengthy history in the industry and a reputation for successfully delivering projects on time and budget, you’ve hit the trifecta!\nHow To Find Trustworthy Software Development Services\nWhat Warning Signs Should I Look For?\nSo, when should you trust your instincts and run screaming for the nearest exit, putting as much distance as possible between you and the candidate at hand?\nIf they don’t have or won’t show you a portfolio of projects and a list of references.\nNumerous negative online reviews frequently mention missed deadlines, low-quality work, and unprofessional behavior.\nIf the company is evasive, slow to respond to your questions, or talks in circles, cross them off the list.\nIf you start to hear grandiose promises like delivering a complex project in an impossibly short time or at a significantly lower cost than others, trust us, you’re in bad company.\nCompanies resistant to an agile methodology aren’t necessarily terrible developers, but forgoing an iterative process and structured development approach can lead to chaotic and disorganized projects with poor communication.\nIf they want you to pay for an initial consultation or post-development support. A reliable software company always offers a complimentary strategy session and includes post-launch support as part of its bid.\nWhat Questions Should I Ask The Software Development Team?\nIf you’ve whittled down your potential partners list to two or three choices, asking the right questions of each one can make the final decision easier. The aim is to choose a software development company that aligns with your goals and values, creating a partnership built on trust and mutual understanding.\nWhy Zibtek Is a Trustworthy Software Development Partner\nWe’re all familiar with smooth-talking, fly-by-night businesses that leave us disillusioned and, in worst-case scenarios, financially drained.Zibtek provides exceptional customer experiences from day one, matching you with experienced and highly skilled engineers who communicate transparently and deliver top-notch solutions. Our strong development track record and history of customer satisfaction are testaments to our trustworthiness and reliability. To learn more, reach out to us today. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

    "extractedText": "BUSINESS\nHow To Choose A Software Development Partner\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n2 DEC 2018 • 4 MIN READ\nMany businesses seek out development specialists for their software and website projects. Most firms don’t have a comprehensive in-house team that can handle complex development projects and, if they do, it’s hard to have all the expertise necessary. As part of seeking tech companies to partner with, businesses will meet with several. But most often clients do not know how to pick the right company because of lack of experience in this particular field.\nHere are some fantastic tips that can assist you in your endeavor to discover the right company:\nExpertise in the Product:\nIt is essential for you to know what your product niche is going to be. Are you planning to create a product to conquer the online banking industry? Or do you want to launch an app to revolutionize the tech-fitness sector? Or are you planning to start a popular social account?\nWhatever the niche, you need to take time to search for a company that has already done similar projects before. Since they have good experience and expertise, they will be able to anticipate your needs and be able to create a product that is apt for your requirements. The costs of the development will reduce when you use an expert because they know how to assist you.\nCommunication Matters the Most\nIt is important for you to find a firm that has a proper communication channel in place. If you want the project to go at a smooth pace, it is critical for you to get weekly and monthly updates on the projects that you are carrying out. Identifying the problems at an early stage and long before the deadline is vital for the project to be considered as successful.\nIf you are finding the issues just days ahead of a major deadline, then there is something wrong. Find a firm that has a proper communication channel in place so that you are on top of the things from the time the project begins. You should also anticipate changes and revisions on the path to the finished project, and you need a team that can adapt quickly.\nExpertise in Technology\nIt’s helpful to think of all web applications as being built using the same elements. Even if you are creating a unique product, you have to use the same starting materials as everyone else. Let’s take the example of Uber. It contains the following building blocks:\nIt’s an app that allows users to sign into an account\nUsers can locate transportation by accessing GPS\nUsers can pay through the app (which, of course, require fraud protection)\nMost of the apps that you find in the app stores were created using the same bricks. Check with the potential companies about their track record of handling these various tools. You need to do this as soon as you complete the technical task document. It’s also helpful to know about the timetable they followed to complete each of these projects that they did before.\nExpertise in Marketing\nIt is essential for you to ask specific questions to move things forward. First and foremost, have you articulated the demographics of your end user? Did you launch a startup before? If yes, do you know how to reach your target users? Are you able to evaluate and compare marketing channels based on ROI?\nIf you do not have any answers to these questions, you run the risk of overspending with no return on investment for development. While you may create a revolutionary product, you might not have many users. If the software development company has an expertise in marketing, besides making the product, they will also assist in marketing it. They will know precisely the features that you may need to cut to trim the budget while still appealing to your target market.A great product with the right core features is the best way to attract your target audience.\nType of the Company:\nEnterprise suppliers are the companies that target large, established businesses. These companies have a lot of procedures, security (cameras as well as fingerprint sensors in offices, for example). They are able to meet complex regulatory standards and review. Their customers are often big banks or large scale corporations.\nStartup Suppliers\nThese types of tech companies sometimes call themselves “studio” or “agency” businesses. These are small companies that work with startup companies. They have decidedly fewer procedures in place, and these companies are agile. Companies of this size are usually ready and eager to sign an NDA. Once the contract is signed, they are ready to discuss the details and start the project.\nThese companies might be experts in a few niches with work that is proven. If you are working on a stipulated budget, you may choose to work with these companies. Any good tech company will know how to code your ideas in accordance with the technical documents. The only problem with these smaller companies is that they do not always think about product success. Their main aim is to ensure that there are no bugs in the application or the product. You’ll need to rely on your own team or additional consulting to market the product well.\nIn a nutshell, these companies are not engineered to assist the customers in finding a product-market fit and sell it. The best option that you have is to work with a smaller team that has the expertise in marketing in your niche to work with you.\nPricing Policy\nNever fall for a company that can’t deliver the product. Even if you only use a subpar partner for an initial product offering and plan to change it in the future, the next team that you are planning to partner with may refuse to fix the issues after careful analysis of the product.\nThese are some things that you may need to consider seriously before partnering with a software development company. The tech industry is growing and dynamic, and if you properly consider your business needs and the capabilities of your potential partners, you can almost certainly find a team able to deliver.

    "extractedText": "APP DEVELOPMENT\nApplication Maintenance Services\nIan J.H Reynolds\nExplore Ian J.H Reynolds' expertise in finance and economics through his insightful articles on market trends, investment strategies, and economic analysis.\nMore posts by Ian J.H Reynolds.\nIAN J.H REYNOLDS\n15 JUN 2020 • 6 MIN READ\nApplication maintenance services both enhance the performance of an organization's software systems and reduce cost by freeing up human resources. Since, organizations have significant costs when it comes to maintaining and supporting their existing IT systems, that means that they often don't have as much budget as they would like to invest in strategic projects and new innovations.\nThis constant upkeep also requires a lot of both human and financial resources, thus placing additional burden on the company’s balance sheet. A better way to go about this is to opt for an application maintenance service.\nApplication Maintenance Services\nMost organizations rely on custom software solutions and apps to streamline their processes and improve efficiency. However, just having these apps and software solutions developed once doesn't end the investment that they need to make in order to keep them running as they're supposed to.\nThese things actually require routine maintenance. Whether that's for fixing any issues, enhancing existing capabilities or adding new functionality, application maintenance is highly necessary.\nOrganizations also have to adapt quickly as changes can rapidly take place in their industry. This means that they must have the resources available to make the required chances and not fall behind the competition.\nTherefore, application maintenance isn't related to just fixing any defects that the software might have. It also entails proactively adding functionality and improving performance of existing applications as and when required.\nAdvantages of application maintenance\nSupporting Innovation\nOne of the biggest advantages of having an application maintenance service is that it frees up an organization’s resources that would have otherwise been used for the maintenance and upkeep of those applications and software.\nTrusting a dedicated service provider with this task ensures that all of the applications are properly managed, looked after, and even improved from time to time. The organization no longer has to exhaust resources from its in-house development team on these tasks. The in-house team is thus freed up to pursue other projects, innovate on new products and operate in a more efficient manner overall.\nIncreasing Productivity\nA proactive approach to application management can provide a productivity boost. The IT team isn't split between upkeep tasks and having to work on new projects as well. If they're made to juggle different tasks at the same time, there's a high chance that their productivity across all of the different tasks will suffer.\nDepending upon the support infrastructure being utilized, the in-house team can be aided by a user support team that answers queries, a technical support team that provides troubleshooting, and even a full-fledged development team that can help out with fixing bugs and issues to free up additional resources for the in-house team.\nAccess A Larger Talent Pool\nOne of the biggest things that CIOs have to worry about is retaining their IT resources. People are always in search of better opportunities and are likely to take them should one arise. Losing a valuable IT resource can put additional strain on an IT team, often leaving CIOs scrambling to hire replacements.\nThat's not something they need to worry about when application management has been handed to a trusted third-party. They will no longer have to worry about hiring the right resources for application maintenance. The service provider will have a large pool of resources from which they can quickly address any and all needs that you as a client have.\nEffortless Scalability\nA managed application maintenance service also allows for effortless scalability. Once your resources have been freed up to focus more on new innovations, there will ultimately come a time when existing products and services have to be scaled up.\nThe service provider can manage scalability for you by adding more capacity and assigning more resources to work on your services. This works the other way as well, if you need to scale down, the service provider can adjust accordingly.\nApplication maintenance services help alleviate the biggest challenges companies face when maintaining and supporting their apps\nLarge organizations can have hundreds of different applications that they rely upon both internally to run the business and externally to connect with their customers. Maintaining and supporting all of these apps can put a significant burden on an in-house development team.\nThis would result in them spending a lot of valuable time that they could be using to come up with new apps or features for just providing support and maintaining the existing applications. This doesn’t benefit the organization as well since it needs to continue paying them but their work becomes less focused on new innovations.\nThis is by far one of the biggest challenges that companies face when they have to maintain their applications. The pace of innovation within the company can slow down and this can have a very negative impact on the business as a whole.\nManaging the IT team becomes a hassle as well. If new resources have to be hired, it puts more strain on the company’s finances and may also restrict its capability to branch out into new areas of growth.\nThe cost of hiring all of the new resources can also eat into the development budget, thus not leaving behind enough money that the organization can then go on and invest in the development of new projects.\nThe quality of service can go down too if there are not enough people assigned to maintaining the apps. That's because any issues that need to be fixed take longer to be fixed and thus results in a consistently bad customer experience.\nAll of these challenges can be overcome by handing off the application maintenance tasks to a trusted third-party service provider. They take a set fee to provide a whole host of services and the fee is always less than what it would cost to raise a dedicated in-house team that would solely be focused on maintenance tasks.\nWhat services are included in application maintenance?\nMost application maintenance service providers offer a comprehensive solution that can include adaptive maintenance, which involves adapting to new hardware or software, corrective maintenance which identifies and removes bugs, as well as perfective maintenance which helps add new functionality.\nThat's not all, though. The service providers can also help with emergency maintenance, in the event that something goes wrong and an immediate fix is required. Since these companies are very well experienced in handling these matters for their clients, they can provide significant value to their clients by lowering risks and increasing predictability, improving quality of service, reducing the total cost of ownership and increasing the return of investment on your apps.\nConsulting services are often provided as well for clients that require roadmap definition for their apps, offshorability analysis and a detailed application portfolio assessment. That's in addition to providing developer support, operations support and support for end users.\nGet the right development firm to give you the application development and maintenance support you need\nThe true advantage of an application management service cannot be realized until you find the right service provider for your organization. Both need to be on the same page in order for this delicate balance to work, otherwise, you’re only going to rack up maintenance costs without having much to show for it.\nThat’s why you should rely on Zibtek for all of your application development and maintenance needs. It's one of the world's leading software development companies that works with both startups and Fortune 500 conglomerates alike. ZIbtek is based in Salt Lake City and has a global talent pool that's all managed from its offices in the United States.\nIt has more than a decade of experience in designing and building great mobile apps, working on a wide range of projects from ERP-integrated mobile experiences to apps that allow teachers to teach on the go. Its developers are highly skilled in iOS, Android, React native, Phonegap and hybrid app development.\nGetting your app developed is just the first step. As you have come to know by now, you also require robust application maintenance services so that the end user experience is never compromised. Zibtek can help you with that as well.\nIt can quickly deploy resources from its vast talent pool of developers that are located across the globe and also in the United States to help with maintenance projects of any scale.

    "extractedText": "ANGULAR\nBenefits of Using AngularJS for Web App Development\nVedant Vyas\nRead more posts by this author.\nVEDANT VYAS\n17 JUL 2023 • 5 MIN READ\nImagine if every time you went to a bookstore, each book was housed in its own room. To find what you’re looking for, you need to move from one room to the next, each time entering a new space that requires you to orient yourself with the layout and adapt to unfamiliar surroundings. After exploring dozens of rooms and still not finding what you came for, you’ll likely walk out. Sadly, no one wins; you lose time you’ll never get back, and the store loses money as the inconvenient and discouraging setup fails to engage potential customers.\nNow picture being in a digital bookstore where every available title is nicely displayed on a single interactive table. You effortlessly scroll away, clicking on books that interest you and reading summaries and reviews without leaving the table. Everything you want or need is right there in front of you.\nWhich experience would you choose?\nSingle-Page and Multi-Page Applications\nIn the world of web application architecture, single-page applications (SPAs) are contained within a single web page. Unlike traditional multi-page applications (MPAs), which load new pages each time a user takes an action, SPAs dynamically update the content on the page without requiring a full page reload. This allows for a smoother and more responsive user experience, similar to that of a desktop application. They’re suitable for various use cases, including social media platforms, real-time applications, and productivity tools.\nSPAs typically rely on JavaScript frameworks and libraries, such as AngularJS, to handle the client-side rendering and manage application state. The framework provides tools and abstractions that simplify the web app development process and handles tasks like routing,\ndata fetching, and component management.\nIn the context of our bookstore analogy, an SPA is akin to having all the books neatly displayed on the single interactive table. AngularJS is the efficient shop owner who curates the book collection to ensure seamless navigation, dynamic updates, and an enhanced user experience. It does this by reducing page reloads and improving interactivity. It can also provide offline capabilities through caching mechanisms, allowing users to continue using the web app even with limited or no internet connectivity.\nBenefits of Using AngularJS for Web App Development\nWhat is AngularJS?\nCreated and maintained by Google, the AngularJS framework is a comprehensive platform for building web applications. The latest version, often called \"Angular 2+\" or “Angular,\" provides a robust set of tools, libraries, and features that facilitate the development of dynamic, scalable, and high-performance web apps.\nPopular with brands like Amazon, PayPal, and Netflix, Angular’s main objective is to help businesses develop SPAs that leverage features like two-way data binding, component-based architecture, and powerful template syntax to deliver exceptional user experiences that drive customer satisfaction and engagement.\nHowever, SPAs can be more complex to develop than traditional MPAs, as they require a greater emphasis on client-side logic and sometimes introduce SEO-related and initial load time challenges. They also often need careful memory and resource management, as the entire application resides in a browser's memory.\nOutsourcing AngularJS web development or augmenting your internal team with experienced Angular engineers can be a smart approach to overcoming these complexities.\nThe Benefits of AngularJS for Web App Development\nAngular brings a boatload of advantages to web app development, such as simplifying development, enhancing user experience, and promoting efficient development team collaboration.\nModularity and code organization. Angular promotes a modular approach to building applications that enhances code organization, reusability, and maintainability, making it easier to develop and scale complex applications.\nTwo-way data binding. This powerful feature establishes synchronization between the model (data) and the view (UI), allowing changes in one to automatically be reflected in the other and vice versa, simplifying the management and updating of data and reducing manual efforts and potential bugs.\nDependency injection. Angular has a built-in dependency injection (DI) system that makes it easy to manage dependencies between different components and services. It also enables the creation of loosely coupled and reusable code, so it’s easier for engineers to write unit tests, enhance code maintainability, and improve application scalability.\nEnhanced productivity. A comprehensive set of tools, libraries, and features that streamline development and boost productivity is what makes Angular a darling of the web app development world. Its extensive ecosystem of resources simplifies common development tasks, accelerates the development process, and lets developers create high-quality web apps with efficiency and ease.\nStrong community support. Angular has nearly 2.5 million active users and a large community of developers worldwide who share extensive documentation, tutorials, and resources. The Google Angular team provides regular updates, bug fixes, and improvements\nto the framework, ensuring long-term support and stability.\nWhile Angular is a preferred choice for building robust and scalable web apps, it’s worth noting that the framework has a steeper learning curve than others. The choice of framework for your project ultimately depends on the specific requirements and preferences of the development team.\nAre There Times to Choose a Framework Other Than AngularJS?\nYep, like any other software development project, there are times when a “popular” framework isn’t necessarily the right choice for your project.\nDon’t get us wrong—we’re big fans of Angular’s ability to build scalable and reliable web apps. But sometimes it just doesn’t make sense to use Angular, such as for:\nShort-term projects or those with limited budgets and resources.\nSEO-optimized apps that would probably benefit from more SEO-friendly frameworks like ReactJS, NodeJS, and Rails, as they provide efficient server-side rendering, high-performance handling of traffic, and built-in SEO-friendly features,\nLightweight web apps with static content, such as landing pages.\nBenefits of Using AngularJS for Web App Development\nWhat Else Should I Use AngularJS For?\nTogether with large and complex web apps, projects that can benefit from Angular include:\nEnterprise web apps\nApps with dynamic content\nProgressive web apps\nLong-term projects\nCross-platform compatibility\nApps that require high-level stability\nShould I Outsource AngularJS Web Development or Hire Internally?\nThat depends. Outsourcing can be beneficial when you have limited in-house expertise or resources. Hiring internally, on the other hand, gives you direct control over the development process.\nIn the end, the best choice is the one that finds the perfect balance between cost, expertise, flexibility, and your project’s specific requirements. Sometimes, the ideal solution is a hybrid one, where you augment your internal team with external experts when needed.\nWhy Zibtek for AngularJS Development?\nPartnering with Zibtek for web app development means working with a team of experienced Angular developers committed to delivering high-quality results.

What could be better than having to write the code once and being able to reuse it multiple times to build apps for any deployment target. If only there was such a technology which could make it possible for web, mobile, native mobile and native desktop apps, right?\nActually, this isn’t a wish that remains unfulfilled. There are a few development technologies that enable developers to get the most out of their work and also reduce the costs involved for clients. Angular happens to be one of those tools and it's also among the most popular. It's built by a team of engineers that have a passion for making web development feel effortless.\nWhat is Angular?\nAngular is a popular web framework used for building apps. It's an open source TypeScript-based framework that's led by the Angular Team at Google in addition to a community of experts and corporations. It's actually a complete rewrite from the very same team that built AngularJS.\nThere are quite a few differences between Angular and AngularJS as it's a complete rewrite of the latter from scratch. Angular isn't limited to the concept of controllers as it uses a hierarchy of components as the main architectural characteristic. It also has a different expression syntax and prioritizes modularity as much of the core functionality has been moved to modules. It comes with support for Angular Universal which runs Angular apps on servers.\nAngular allows for versatile development. It's a modern web platform that can be used to deliver app-like experiences in progressive web apps. It supports cross-platform development, enabling developers to create native mobile apps with strategies from Cordova, Ionic, or NativeScript. It's even possible to develop desktop-installed apps for Mac, Windows and Linux with the same Angular methods used for web apps in addition to the ability to access native operating system APIs.\nSpeed and performance is prioritized in Angular. It turns templates into code that's optimized for JavaScript virtual machines. It's also universal as developers can serve the first view of their app on Node.js, .NET, PHP, and other servers for near-instant rendering in only HTML and CSS. Angular is often coupled in the MEAN stack for increased speed and interoperability.\nThrough code splitting, Angular apps can load quality with the new Component Router that provides automatic code splitting so that users only load the code that's required to render the view they have requested.\nAdvantages of the Angular framework\nAngular is a great app design framework and development platform for those who want to create highly efficient and sophisticated single-page apps. The speed and convenience that it provides is one of its biggest advantages. Developers can quickly create UI views with simple and powerful template syntax. They can use command line tools to start building fast and deploy instantly. Angular also provides intelligent code completion, instant errors, and other feedback that's relevant to the work being done.\nDevelopers can keep an eye on the full development story when they're working with Angular. They have access to Karma for unit tests and they can easily know if they have broken something every time they push new code. The Protractor tool allows them to run scenario tests faster and in a more stable environment. Angular's intuitive API can be used to create high-performance and complex choreographies and animation timelines as well.\nThis is one of the main reasons why Angular has become one of the most commonly used programming languages. Many major companies are using it for their own developments, including but not limited to Netflix, PayPal, General Motors, and perhaps the most obvious of them all, Google.\nWhat does an Angular developer do?\nAn angular developer has many different responsibilities to take care of in their role. They are required to provide a complete front end application that functions as per the client's requirement. They also have to make sure that the application meets performance benchmarks for all of the platforms that it's going to be available on.\nDevelopers also have to write and document elements of CSS, HTML, and JavaScript depending on the nature of the project that they're working on. While building the RESTful API, they also have to collaborate with back end developers and have to remain in close contact with external web services so that everything keeps operating the way it's supposed to.\nAngular developers require a certain level of skills that they can utilize in their projects. A deep understanding of Core JavaScript will certainly come in handy since it's basically the building block of many application frameworks. It goes without saying that the developer needs to have an extremely in-depth grasp of the Angular framework. It's important to refresh knowledge and skills as well since Angular is updated and new versions are released quite frequently.\nWhy do you need Angular developers on your project?\nAngular is counted among the most powerful JavaScript frameworks and it's backed by incredible support from Google. It also has a very strong community of developers. The expertise that Angular developers can bring to your project is going to be unmatched, provided that you have hired the right people for the job.\nIt's vital that your idea be communicated to the developers properly so that they can form a good understanding of what's required of them. They need to understand your vision for the project so that they can inform you of the potential challenges that you might face while working on the job and what might be the best way to overcome them.\nYour project can benefit from the excellent knowledge of web markup, HTML, and CSS that Angular developers have. They will have a firm understanding of UX concepts, the positioning of elements, and elements interaction. This level of expertise comes in handy if you're looking to create a very high quality product.\nHire talented Angular developers for your custom project\nYou now have a solid understanding of why Angular is such a popular framework and how it can be beneficial to your project. Unless you’re a major tech company, it’s unlikely that you have an in-house team of developers that work for you full time. Even if you wanted to establish such a team, it would require a lot of investment in terms of both time and resources.\nThis could potentially push back the development time for your project. You’ll have to send the word out first that you require Angular developers, then conduct interviews to assess their skills before extending them offers and waiting to hear back from them. It’s quite the tedious process, one that can simply be circumvented by outsourcing the job to highly skilled professionals.\nSure, you could try to bring in part-time freelancers, but that could end up causing you more problems than actually fixing the ones that you have right now. It’s often difficult to keep track of the work they’re doing and there can often be a mismatch between your expectations for the project and what they’re willing or even capable of doing.\nTherefore, it’s always best to trust your project to highly skilled professionals who are not going to over promise and then under deliver, leaving you to foot the bill for a massive development project that didn’t even provide you with the product you wanted.\nThis is where Zibtek comes into the picture.

As an open-source framework with highly advanced JavaScript support, Angular is an attractive solution for developing web applications. Angular is developed, maintained and supported by Google and has a solid code base. It is the outcome of innovative work by Google engineers, Misko Hevery and Adam Abrons. The relationship with Google and seamless support are some of the reasons why Angular is popular among developers (Why_developers_are_choosing_Angular) over other JavaScript frameworks. Looking at its high marketability pace in this era of technological advancement, we have listed some noteworthy reasons why you should choose Angular:\n1. Perfect implementation of Model View Controller (MVC) architecture\nThe angular framework is based on MVC (#1_Based_on_MVC architecture (a software design pattern used to develop web applications). It makes the code easier to extend and maintain in the future. There are other web development frameworks as well that are built on MVC architecture but Angular is perhaps the most popular among all of them.\nHow is MVC implemented in other web frameworks?\nFirst, you need to split your app into MVC components (Model, View, and Controller).\nLater, you are required to write code to combine these components together again.\nSometimes, other frameworks require developers to write shortcuts between the components that deteriorate the quality of the software. Therefore, implementing an MVC in any other framework is a difficult and time-consuming process for developers.\nHow is MVC implemented in Angular?\nIt allows you to split the app into MVC components.\nAfter that, Angular will perform the rest of the work.\nAngular handles your application components and serves as a channel that assimilates these components into a single application again. It lets developers create specialized apps in less time than other methods.\n2. Declarative UI support\nThe Angular framework relies on HTML for creating excellent user interfaces for mobile and web applications. HTML is a declarative language that is assisted by technologies, such as scripting language (JavaScript) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). It is used to define the structure of the web content.\nLet’s take a look at what makes HTML an amazing markup language for Angular applications-\nHTML offers some special attributes that determine which controllers (https://www.w3schools.com/angular/angular_controllers.asp) (they control the data of Angular applications) you should use for a particular element. These attributes also decide “what” to load instead of “how” to load. This approach has significantly simplified app development from the What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) aspect. It means you don’t need to worry about the program flows, you simply need to characterize your application needs, and Angular will take care of all the dependencies and related conditions.\n3. Uses Plain Old JavaScript Objects (POJO) data models\nIn Angular, data models are plain old JavaScript objects (POJO). POJO is an ordinary Java object (https://www.guru99.com/java-oops-class-objects.html#2), introduced by Sun Microsystems. It is easy to write and understand and also increases the reusability of the program. With POJO, your code will look more intuitive and much cleaner because-\nYou don’t need to insert complex functions and methods in your code.\nIt uses single declarative references.\nIt purely focuses on business logic.\nIt has no dependencies on the framework.\nUsing POJO in Angular will help you to develop an intuitive, light-weight and specialized app.\n4. Directives that quickly enhance functionality\nAngular directives help you to quickly incorporate extra functionality to HTML. Some basics about Angular Directives:\nBy adding new attributes to HTML, you can easily extend its functionalities in Angular. These attributes are called directives.\nAngular contains a set of built-in directives that offers functionality for your applications.\nYou can define your own directives in Angular.\nYour app only needs to set attributes to elements in order to create enhanced functionality. Angular directives accomplish this by enabling us to create our own HTML elements.\n5. Less coding\nWith Angular, you don’t need to write much code while developing web-based applications. As discussed in point no. 3, Angular uses POJO model which doesn’t require additional features or complex coding. Also, in point 4, we have discussed Angular directives. Let’s discuss how Angular directives contribute to requiring less coding.\nHow do Angular directives contribute to less coding?\nYou can easily initiate an Angular application and application data in just one line of code.\nYou can seamlessly bind the values of HTML elements with application data by just adding a few code snippets.\nYou can easily bind the value of HTML controls (including text area, select, input) to application data in just a few lines of code.\nDirectives are separate from application code; so, another team can take the task of writing the code in parallel. This, in turn, minimizes the integration issues and application development time.\n6. Easy to use filters\nFilters in Angular are used to format data for display to the user. It is basically used to manipulate the data on the view level (the user interface). Here are the following Angular filters- currency formats a number to a currency. For eg. $52 lowercase converts a text to a lower case number formats a number to a string. orderBy sorts or arranges an array (an ordered collection of items) by an expression. filter selects a subset of items from an array.date formats date to a specified format. uppercase converts a text into upper case letters.json formats an object to a JSON (https://www.json.org/)string. limitTo limits a string/array to a specified number of characters.\nFilters are easy to add in Angular. It can be added in the expressions by using the pipe character | Suppose you want to format a text into upper case letters, let’s see how easily you can do this by adding filters:\nName Upper Case: {{student.fullName() | uppercase}}\nMore about Angular filters\nFilters are standalone functions that make it possible to create a sortable HTML table without even writing JavaScript code.\nSimilar to Angular directives, Angular filters are also separated from your app.\n7. Edge with modules and simplified testing\nWith Angular, you can build the application by combining the set of separate modules (https://angular.io/guide/architecture-modules). These modules can be independent of one another or dependent on each other. For example, you can add a Gmail login module (as an independent module) in certain areas of your app. Angular will easily recognize these additional objects in your app and unite them together. This module separation approach in angular lets you load only necessary functions and services, making automated testing easy for the testers.\n8. Parallel development and code reusability\nAngular allows developers to write and test the code in parallel. This parallel workflow reduces the development and testing time for applications. Another reason why Angular is emerging as an industry leader in the app world is its code reusability feature.\nLet’s understand what is so special about the code reusability feature:\nIn an application, there may be a number of ‘dumb’ (https://angular.io/guide/architecture-components) (Dumb components act as a brick in your application wall, you can take the control over these components and place them anywhere in your application code) that can’t even determine their own internal status. In Angular, you can easily reuse these dumb components by removing unnecessary things and focus only on what you need.\nLet’s suppose you have developed an app and on one of the webpages, the designer wants a pop-up alert dialog box before the delete confirmation message. On the other webpage, he wants you to delete three images and add an image to another section. Thanks to the code usability feature of Angular, you don’t need to panic about these changes. You can easily reuse required components or a ‘dumb’ component (that doesn’t determine internal status, hence they won’t affect the other areas of the code) into your code.\nFor more information about what factors to consider when choosing an angular\ndevelopment company check out this article.

For many developers it's important to have Angular explained. Building great and scalable applications quickly is a key challenge. Enterprises are looking for a robust framework to simplify the development and testing process. To provide a complete enterprise solution, Google developed an open-source front-end web application framework known as Angular. With Angular, developers can build dynamic and modern web applications quickly.\nHere are some of the many versions of Angular:\nAngularJS is the first version of the Angular framework, developed in 2009. It has gained huge admiration over the years for ensuring reliable and fast apps.\nIn 2016, Google developed a successor to AngularJS, known as Angular 2. It was a complete rewrite of the AngularJS framework.\nIn March 2017, Angular 4 was released. It is backward compatible with Angular 2. It came with an improved view-engine and code-generation reductions. The Angular 4.3 upgrade was released in July 2017. It featured HttpClient to provide a smaller and easier-to-use library for making HTTP requests.\nAngular 5 was released in November 2017. It includes support for-\nProgressive Web Apps (PWA)- It is an improvement to existing technology.\nBuild optimizer- It is a command-line tool that eliminates unnecessary coding and makes the application faster.\nImproved Material Design- Material Design for Angular is modern UI components for web, mobile, and desktop applications.\nIn May 2018, Angular 6 was released. It focused on a toolchain that makes it easier to migrate your applications to Angular.\nAngular 7.0 was released in October 2018. It focused on improving application performance. There is also visual improvements in Angular Material Design and CDK (Component Dev Kit) such as: Virtual Scrolling, Improved Accessibility of Selects, etc. Angular 7.1 mainly focused on bug fixes and router capabilities. And the current version- Angular 7.2 -released in January 2019. It improved the core framework by enhancing router capabilities and integrating Bazel (a tool used to build and test software) support.\nFrom AngularJS in 2009 to Angular 7.2 in 2020, this front-end framework has evolved rapidly. Today, Angular is used by more than 70% of software engineers for creating modern web-based applications.\nAngular JS\nAngular JS is an open-source Javascript framework that follows the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern. It is used in developing Single Page Applications (SPA) projects.\nHTML is great if you are declaring static documents, but it gets clumsy when you are using it for declaring dynamic web applications. To address this issue, AngularJs extends HTML with additional attributes to make the applications more responsive to the users. AngularJS also speeds up your front-end development.\nAngular Explained: Main features of AngularJS\n1. Based on MVC\nIn this next part of Angular Explained, we talk about Angular JS. AngularJS is built on the concept of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework. MVC is a software design pattern used in the development of web applications, in which:\nThe Model maintains the data related to the application and represents the business logic.\nThe View is a user interface that displays data to the users. It also enables users to modify the data.\nThe Controller is a code that controls the interaction between Model and View. A URL request is raised when the user interacts with View. This request is handled by the Controller.\nAfter receiving the user’s request for applications, the Controller collaborates with the Model to prepare data needed by the View. After this, the View uses that data to display a presentable response to the users.\n2. Two-way data binding\nThis provides synchronization between the Model and the View. The View reflects the change as soon as data in the Model changes; similarly, the Model reflects the change as soon as the data in View changes. This enables the **Model **and View to be updated in real-time.\nWith this feature of AngularJS, you can bind the data to the HTML controls by just adding a few snippets of code, eliminating the need to write lots of code.\n3. Dependency Injection\nDependency Injection (DI) is a feature of AngularJS that deals with how components get hold of their dependencies. With the dependency injection, you can describe (in a declarative manner) how your application is wired. Including main()method in coding sometimes becomes difficult to maintain, but with DI, your applications don’t need **main() **method. DI is a core feature of AngularJS that can replace any components that don’t fit the user’s needs.\nAngularJS comes up with built-in testability features. It takes full advantage of DI and eliminates test flakiness.\n4. Ready to use templates\nAngularJS provides ready-to-use templates to ease your front-end development process. Even people with little computing skills can design top-quality applications.\nAngular 2\nThe original AngularJS JavaScript development framework was accepted widely by the developers. But it has some limitations. To deliver better performance, Google endeavored a rewrite for the second generation, resulting in Angular 2.\nAngular 2 is re-written in TypeScript. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. In TypeScript, we can easily do a static analysis of source code. Unlike in Javascript, the code is more predictable in TypeScript.\nAdditional features in Angular 2:\nIn Angular 2, the code can run speedily in JavaScript virtual machines. This is because the compiler is placed between written code and output shipped to a production application.\nIt offers a cleaner structural component model that focuses on interoperation with technologies.\nDifference between AngularJS and Angular 2\nAngular 2 is written on TypeScript while AngularJS is written on JavaScript.\nAngularJS uses the concept of scope and controller. Scoping a variable enables you to add many variables that will be visible in View and Controller. But Angular 2 doesn’t have a concept of scope and controller.\nUnlike AngularJS, Angular 2 supports Angular Universal (a technology that uses the server to run an Angular application).\nUnlike AngularJS, Angular 2 has its own modern UI components, called Angular Material. Together these components work across the web, mobile, and desktop.\nIn AngularJS, you have to remember the right ng directive to bind an event, but Angular 2 uses “()” for event binding and “[ ]” for property binding.\nAngularJS uses rootScope, which allows the variables to be available throughout the application. On the other hand, Angular 2 uses the concept of components and directives as its main architectural approach, where the component is a directive with a template.\nCurrent version: Updates of Angular 7.2\nAngular 7.2 was released in January 2019. With Bazel support, it is helping developers and testers in the development process. It has also enhanced routing capabilities. Here are the updates of Angular 7.2:\n1. Bazel support\nTo help developers and testers in automating the development process and testing of software, the Angular team has integrated the tool Bazel into Angular.Bazel is a free software tool that you can use to build and test software quickly.\nHow to use Bazel in your project:\nInstall Bazel schematics by using @angular/bazel. After this, the build will be managed by Bazel.\nExecute the command ng new, like this-\nng new bzl-app–collection=@angular/bazel\n2. Enhanced Router capabilities\nLet’s understand the enhanced core router capabilities in technical parameters:\nIncorporation of Navigation type during router navigation has targeted URLs, Navigation and NavigationExtras data.\nAllow for passing of state to routerLink directives, as well as passing of state to NavigationExtras.\nWhen navigating the previous page, the restoration of the whole process is managed by Angular router.\nIntroducing pathParamsOrQueryParamsChange mode for runGuardsAndResolvers which updates the UI and syncs the URL with local changes. This offers the following:\nGuard and resolver ignore changes to matrix parameters.\nWhenever there is any change in the path, guards and resolver will be rerun.\nIf you are not familiar with Angular guards and resolver, then have a look at this:\nGuards in Angular:Implementing the guard types (CanActivate, CanDeactivateand CanLoad) is used to protect routes. It decides if a user is allowed to activate a certain route, leaving a certain route, or even asynchronously loading a route.\nAngular resolver:enables you to provide the datarequired for a route before the route becomes active.\nWhy developers are choosing Angular?\nIt is opinionated- Angular offers developers defaults for things like: language choice, state management, network connectivity, build toolchain, etc. The angular team continuously tests and validates these defaults to ensure a reliable and steady Angular platform.\nIt is trustworthy-\nBeing a Google product, Angular can take advantage of all the testing infrastructure offered by Google.Google validates every change made to the Angular framework.\nThere are no possibilities of breaking changes or regressions in Angular because the framework is already being tested in hundreds of projects before its public release.\nIt has a strong ecosystem- Angular owns numerous reusable tools, code samples, and libraries. These tools are continually updated. Companies such as VMWare, NativeScript, and Teradata have full support for Angular.\nThe Angular ecosystem includes many tech-giants, such as Oasis Digital, Thinkster and Galvanize. Many companies such as Range, Nrwl, etc., have a majority of their businesses in Angular only. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

Great coders know that good work comes from a robust framework that simplifies the development and testing process. To provide developers a platform that quickly builds web applications, Google developed an open-source web application framework known as Angular.\nSome key points about Angular:\nIt facilitates front-end development.\nIt is developed from the JavaScript framework.\nIt empowers developers with features to build apps for any deployment target.\nWith its declarative templates, it allows developers to build amazing apps without requiring them to do lots of coding.\nWith the changing demands of front-end developers, the Angular team worked on perfecting their techniques. Angular provides a variety of tools to assist front-end developers in building apps.\nReasons why developers hesitate to migrate\nDevelopers sometimes hesitate to make the transition from their older infrastructure. Typically, the reasons are:\nThey have to learn an entirely new methodology, despite having spent time learning how to migrate to AngularJS.\nThey need to renew workflows that are already well-implanted into the company’s structure.\nThey need to rewrite code.\nBut migrating to Angular is a long-term solution to app development that is worth the initial investment.\nWhy Angular?\nAngular is one of the most powerful frameworks in the market. We have listed some of its advantages and features. It will help you to evaluate carefully before migrating to a new infrastructure.\nCode consistency\nUnlike traditional software, modern software isn’t meant to be coded in a way that requires the programmer to update the code throughout the years. The Angular framework goes well with the modern software development methodology. It ensures code consistency and offers several benefits:-\nEditing your existing code becomes much easier, as you don’t need to go through the entire code.\nEnsures simplified unit testing\nImproves readability of the code\nEnables efficient code maintenance\nWhile delayed launches or increased costs are the risks associated with inconsistent coding, consistent coding makes websites easier to use and enables the use of templates or pre-defined code snippets.\nComponents\nLater versions of Angular use component-based systems, eradicating the complex methodology of AngularJS. Component-based codes are easier to read and write. Each component has a defined specification that is independent of its environment. It makes them highly reusable across the app, ensuring a smooth development process for developers.\nMost developers face issues in maintaining code. Angular addresses this maintainability issue, as it is written in Typescript. Typescript is derived from JavaScript and provides the following benefits:\nEnables developers to find bugs and errors earlier in the process.\nSpeeds up the development process\nReduces run-time errors, by recognizing mistakes before they come to light.\nRight approach for mobile apps\nAngularJS was developed with the emergence of mobile apps. Before the advent of AngularJS, mobile apps didn’t have the same level of ubiquity they have today. Lazy loading technique of Angular has introduced an idea to load modules only when they’re needed. It makes applications faster from the user’s perspective.\nFor more agile and active performance, some of the non-essential packages are also moved from the framework’s core, hence facilitating a mobile-driven approach.\nHow to migrate your application smoothly to angular\nWhether you are migrating a web app or making the transition from an old company’s designs to a new one, Angular brings you a lot of benefits for your projects. But the things you should follow while undergoing migration process are:\nAdopt a seamless migration\nMigrating a web application to Angular requires developers to rewrite the existing code. Both frameworks- AngularJS and Angular can operate in the same application together. It allows you to make the transition over time without worrying about migrating everything all at once.\nTools that will help you to migrate from AngularJS to Angular:-\nngMigration assistant: It is a command-line tool that recommends a migration path after analyzing an AngularJS application. It provides data regarding the complexity, volume, and pattern of an app.\nngMigration forum: It is a community hub that answers all your migration questions while directing you to the migration solution. Here you can learn and share information on Angular migration.\nApproach TypeScript\nThe original AngularJS was written in vanilla JavaScript, but later it was updated to TypeScript. TypeScript builds on modern JavaScript. Fundamentally, TypeScript is similar to JavaScript, but it brings you numerous advantages.\nIn the future, to save yourself from trouble and to get efficient results, keep the following things in mind while approaching TypeScript to migrate:\nGo through the entire existing code block instead of just renaming your file extensions\nBefore full migration, make some annotations in code blocks.\nConsider TestBed cautiously\nChecking for bugs and unit testing requires a large workforce. Even considering it can scare many away from migrating to a new framework. Fortunately, Angular offers an amazing testing utility, known as TestBed. It configures and initializes the environment for unit testing.\nConsidering the size and scale of your project, keep the following things in mind:\nFor smaller projects, TestBed can be a viable method to test codes.\nBut, in a larger project that requires running thousands of tests, TestBed will be slow. It can be an extensive process for such projects.\nStepping into the migration process can pay off in the long run. It will be a smart move for your company if you take advantage of the benefits migration offers. Don’t be afraid to make a jump to Angular, if you want to speed up your development, debugging, and security processes or partner with a proficient angularjs development company.

    "extractedText": "PRACTICAL AGILE\nContinuous Development: The Piece-by-Piece Path to Deployment\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n4 MAR 2021 • 2 MIN READ\nAn agile approach to software development calls for agility through all phases of a project’s lifecycle.\nWhat is Continuous Development?\nContinuous development (CD) focuses on the idea of ongoing improvement, planning, testing, delivering, and gathering feedback to continually improve the product.\nWhile a lot of people approach the CD topic with the idea everything must be 100% automated, the truth is there’s a lot of baby steps that can occur as we mature into CD. And while there is, of course, a lot of value in automation during the software development process, there’s also a lot of practical value in Continuous development.\nContinuous development\nHow Continuous Development Works\nRather than testing and improving a product in various large batches, Continuous development makes continuous updates piece-by-piece. It’s an easier process that lets us deliver software as soon as it’s completed and tested.\nDepending on which control system’s being used, a main branch may be called the master, mainline, default, or trunk. At Zibtek, we use the term trunk. Branches are smaller with fewer lines of code, which makes them infinitely easier to test. Code branches are an efficient way to organize small development features, but just like branches on a tree, they’re only viable when they become part of the trunk. In CD branches should be short lived and merged quickly.\nContinuous Development Process\nThe Continuous development process allows us to develop and deploy software projects in the most efficient, effective, and optimal way possible. It can be thought of as an “umbrella” over other processes, including continuous testing, writing user stories, feature flags, and more. Companies like Netflix, Google, Facebook, and even Tesla use the CD process to complete multiple releases per week or month.\nContinuous development supports the entire agile mentality by enabling teams to:\nFocus their testing, which means less breakage, fewer lines of code means a smaller blast zone. The bigger the task, the more time is spent coding, deploying, and testing.\nAvoid the risks that come with launching large projects that might fail. Teams can introduce new concepts in a lean and agile manner. Small iterations are deployed and tested quickly and more easily pulled back if necessary.\nDeploy small tickets for faster feedback loops. And because the feedback loop from various stakeholders is expedited and continuous, developers are always provided with more tasks to better optimize the product.\nAutomate policies on the trunk according to established coding standards.\nCombine automated testing with manual steps that prevent untested or unapproved code from getting into the pipeline.\nBenefits of Continuous Development\nContinuous Development also allows people working on the product to connect with one another. Operations, QA, testers, everyone works together to ensure the build process is done correctly and standard work practices are used.\nOne of the greatest benefits to Continuous Development is how swiftly new features can be developed and deployed. New iterations can be tested much faster, and automated tests quickly identify incompatibilities and bugs which can be addressed almost immediately. This accelerated process means you’re able to see a faster return on your investment than you would with other deployment methods.

    "extractedText": "What is QA Automation?\nIan J.H Reynolds\nExplore Ian J.H Reynolds' expertise in finance and economics through his insightful articles on market trends, investment strategies, and economic analysis.\nMore posts by Ian J.H Reynolds.\nIAN J.H REYNOLDS\n26 MAR 2020 • 7 MIN READ\nThat’s why many companies rely on quality assurance (QA) automation to continually test their software more effectively and more frequently than manual testers can.\nIf you are looking for best practices for an Agile QA process, don't forget to check out our practical agile series.\nQA automation, explained.\nQA automation refers to using a separate piece of software to run tests on the software that you’re developing. In the past, human testers would have to perform many of these tasks themselves, with the aid of some technology to reduce repetition.\nBut automated testing can handle many of these tasks entirely, and can even perform more advanced tests that aren’t possible to do by hand.\nThere are several ways to incorporate QA automation into your company, including:\nDeveloping tests from scratch with your in-house development team\nUsing codeless test automation software designed for non-coders\nOutsourcing your tests to a third-party QA service\nAutomated QA testing is important for companies that practice continuous integration, which means that software is developed, tested, and deployed multiple times per day, rather than in stages, as was common in more traditional development models.\nSoftware testing is used to detect serious bugs and security vulnerabilities, as well as user experience issues, such as glitches that only appear in specific use cases.\nHow does QA automated testing work?\nAlthough the testing process itself can be automated, it still takes some understanding of programming in order to write the script that performs the test.\nTypically, your development team will write the source code for your QA tests, but if you use codeless testing software, you may be able to write the tests using keywords.\nThere are two main ways to automate QA testing:\nGUI (graphical user interface) testing\nAPI testing\nGUI testing is a type of QA testing that replicates the user experience. For example, it can perform a series of mouse clicks and keystrokes to ensure that the program works as intended, while recording any irregularities for playback and review.\nWhile GUI testing is similar to the kinds of tests that could be run by hand, automation speeds up the process, and eliminates any variablities caused by human error.\nThe test can be run exactly the same way each time, or used to test different features of the software in each iteration, providing more accurate results and bug reports.\nAPI testing is used to test the application programming interface, which doesn’t have a GUI and therefore needs to be tested at the message layer.\nThese tests can be used to assess both third-party APIs and those built in-house, with a focus on testing end-to-end transactions as well as individual software components.\nThis may include testing response time and response format, security attack responses, and how well the software handles boundary conditions and edge cases.\nAPI tests can also use service virtualization to represent the behavior of each individual component without having to run a live test on cloud-based applications.\nQA automation is the best thing you can do for your new software.\nQA automation is one of the key tools that startups and SaaS businesses can use to get their products to market faster, with fewer bugs and less downtime. The main benefit to QA automation is speed. Traditional software development models treat the coding and testing processes as separate stages of development, so it takes longer for developers to recognize a problem and change course to fix it.\nWith QA automation, testing can take place more frequently, making it easier to uncover issues and respond to user feedback. You can test individual components one at a time, rolling out updates without having to go back to the drawing board.\nIncorporating automated testing into your development plan from the start can help your team anticipate problems and write stronger code.\nAdditionally, automated testing typically requires less time and money than manual QA testing. Instead of paying someone to perform every test, you’ll simply have to pay your developers or testing company to write and execute the software.\nIn particular, you’ll benefit from automated regression testing, which is used to ensure that a piece of software still works after changes have been made to it.\nFrom software patches to enhancements, any changes to your product can create new bugs or cause old ones to reemerge.\nAutomated testing allows you to record a test that locates a bug, and re-run the same test with each change to the software to make sure that it doesn’t reappear.\nYou can also create tests based on product acceptance criteria, and test your software against worse case scenarios, such as DDoS attacks and cross-site scripting.\nAs your software becomes more complex, automated QA testing allows you deliver a high quality product without slowing down due to bugs and other technical issues.\nTypes of software tests:\nThe specific QA tests that you need to run will depend on the type of software and your development methods. A cloud app that depends on continuous integration may require more complex testing than internal software developed using the waterfall model.\nSome of the common tests you’ll encounter include the following:\nUnit tests are among the easiest QA tests to automate, since they involve testing the smallest pieces of your software application, or units.\nWith unit testing, it’s easy to diagnose a bug, because you can run one of these very specific tests to pinpoint where the issue is located.\nUnit tests are typically run locally, and are not intended for testing components that are linked to a database or remote web services.\nThey’re often designed by the same programmers who wrote the code for the unit.\nIn one approach, called test-driven development (TDD), each piece of code is subjected to repeated tests, and only added to the software when the test can be passed.\nIntegration tests are a step up from unit tests in that they test multiple components at once, such as whether or not the software can connect to the right web services.\nAn integration test can trial a customer action, such as placing an online order, to see whether certain steps, like sending a confirmation email, are working properly.\nThese tests cost more time and money to design, but are key to making sure that your app or software works as a whole.\nThey run at the code level, rather than through the user interface.\nFunctional tests are similar to integration tests, but while integration tests make sure that the components work, functional tests focus make sure output is correct.\nThey’re referred to as a form of black-box testing, in that the internal systems are not examined, so the tester doesn’t need to know or understand the underlying code.\nSmoke tests are essentially used as spot checks. They’re used to test the stability of a build to determine whether or not the most important features are working.\nIf they are, the build can be moved on to more extensive testing; if not, the developers can troubleshoot the issues first, before spending any more time testing it.\nEnd-to-end tests are among the most comprehensive tests, so they require frequent maintenance and access to any relevant web services or databases.\nHowever, they’re key to making sure that your entire system runs as intended, such as verifying that online purchases are reflected in your CRM.\nPerformance tests are non-functional tests used to test a system’s performance, such as verifying its speed or stability under high data loads.\nAnd finally, regression tests, as we saw earlier, confirm that a change to the software hasn’t introduced any new or previously known bugs.\nThese are some of the most important QA tests that can be automated, but this is by no means an exhaustive list, and some tests may fall under more than one category.\nOpen source QA testing tools:\nIf you’re interested in doing your own QA testing, there are plenty of open source tools that allow you to create your own automated test scripts. These include:\nSelenium. This is one of the most popular open source testing tools because it offers plug-ins for a variety of programming languages and works with multiple browsers and OS systems. You can use Selenium WebDriver to build regression tests based in your browser, or Selenium Grid to run your tests at scale across multiple machines.\nAppium. This testing tool is designed for mobile apps, including web, hybrid, and native apps on Android, iOS, and Windows.\nCucumber. This tool is designed for Behavior Driven Development (BDD), and allows non-technical customers to help determine how a piece of software should behave.\nGet QA automation done professionally.\nOf course, not every company wants to do their own testing, and if you’d rather hire a team of professional QA testers to get it right, that’s an option too. The team at Zibtek has experience developing and testing a range of software, and provides customized QA and QC services for web apps, mobile apps, CRM platforms, and more.\nWhether you need a one-time end-to-end test, or a series of integration tests as you work towards continuous deployment, the developers at Zibtek can help you out.

They could carry this data and sell it on the dark web to others or they could use it as a jumping-off point for bigger campaigns.\nBy allowing hackers to access delicate information, you jeopardize your business and run the risk of serious legal ramifications.\nIt’s not reasonable for organizations to predict every possible kind of attack. Instead, they may create a cybersecurity approach that does its best to avoid assaults, regardless of how they are provided.\nAI is progressively advancing, and automation’s operational effectiveness advantages have been extensively demonstrated. This is why, in their battle against cyber-attacks, both the government and private sectors now turn to AI and automation.\nBenefits of using AI in cybersecurity\nArtificial Intelligence has a human touch:\n![Human touch in AI]\n(https://zibtek.com/blog/content/images/2019/06/human-touch-in-AI.jpeg)\nIt is important not to underestimate the significance of getting extremely qualified individuals in the trenches. People are capable of abstract thinking, unlike AI alternatives whose results are based on (admittedly enormous) rule sets. This is essential when dealing with cyber-attacks. After all, every attack now has a human point of origin, and even the most sophisticated AI and machine learning algorithms can not really comprehend–or expect to imitate–the messy and varied nature of the human mind.\nUltimately,despite the hype and the ‘AI washing’, the technology remains at the edge. A mixed approach that integrates human abilities with automation offers more coverage in a globe where every bit of software could hide a prospective danger.\nArtificial intelligence can enhance cybersecurity in three different respects.\nAI can manage quantity:\nArtificial intelligence automates the detection method of sophisticated threats. AI can analyze the very large volume of activity that occurs across the network of a company and the massive volume of emails, files, and websites that employees access in a small fraction of the time that people need. While AI in identifying threats is not 100 percent precise, it can recognize the large bulk of benign behavior and specimens, enabling its human counterparts to concentrate on the comparatively tiny amount of suspect, possibly malicious activities remaining.\nOver time, AI cybersecurity can learn\nAI can identify damaging attacks completely through an application’s suspect behaviors on a network. This ultimately allows AI cybersecurity to know about a network’s periodic traffic and operations. Even the slightest deviation from the norm will be picked up by AI.\nAI hits the bullseye\nHundreds of millions of harmful attacks are initiated every year. Well trained cybersecurity professionals find it difficult to catch up with these threats. Cybersecurity solutions which use AI don’t depend on human approval; they can spot a zero-day attack.\nDrawbacks of using AI in cybersecurity.\nNetwork safety\nApplication safety\nEndpoint data safety\nDatabase and storage safety\nCloud & Mobile safety\nDisaster recovery / business continuity scheduling\nEnd-user schooling\nUse AI to optimize the results of cybersecurity\nCybersecurity software centered on artificial intelligence is used in its current form to:\nAccelerate event identification using processing authority\nSpot safety hazards depending on configuration mistakes and vulnerabilities of software\nClassification & prioritization of attacks\nAutomate threat reaction\nAs technology is evolving rapidly, so are prospective threats to cybersecurity. Apps, smart devices and cloud facilities have achieved a lot to make life easier for customers and generate excellent financial possibilities for IT businesses and the experts working for them. As information and software increases the potential hackers also increase. This increases the danger of cyber criminals acting while analyzing information silos. AI can assist fix this issue by dramatically reducing analysts’ time to operate through and covering up safety gaps.\nAI and the cybersecurity employment market\nThe present artificial intelligence situation in the cyber safety globe has rightly been called the first gears of cybersecurity with AI, a technique that enables people to resolve problems immediately. Having a well-trained professional to monitor creates all the difference. Because it depends on current information, it will be difficult for AI to define creative methods that cyber criminals often use. Skilled cyber safety experts need to use AI and automation of the safety scheme as tools to optimize outcomes.\nArtificial intelligence can enhance cybersecurity in three different respects\nInformation:\nIn order to work with artificial intelligence, information must be evaluated before it can be registered or live. Both types of data sources can be helpful in assessing a cyber environment. For a long time, the government has produced large amounts of data and the key is to identify the right part of the data with the right streams to get the best results. In addition, enhanced information interaction between the private sector and the government can magnify this data inventory.\nInterpretation:\nThis is the method of information collection and the use of technology to provide perspectives into safety networks. Agency staff will create designs for monitored and unsupervised reasons with machine learning and artificial intelligence. Supervised designs use recognized result datasets and construct a template to predict or rank the conduct that led to that result. Unmonitored designs do the same, except that they work with information where there is no recognized result. It searches for deviations in the information that can demonstrate abnormalities that are reflective of safety events and find regions of interest that would be hard for human observers to find. That said, there is not often much information marked.\nDisposition:\nDisposition/deployment is where the value of analytics is understood. Organizations take the findings from the interpretation phase and make relevant changes to their system to fight these problems. This may include paying closer attention to a specific network and fortifying the regularly attacked areas. However, to embrace more sophisticated capacities such as artificial intelligence, it is essential to re-emphasize the need for stronger information compilation, sharing and use.\nWhy this matters for your business\nAI techniques such as machine learning and natural linguistic processing allow researchers to react more confidently and quickly to threats.\nAI becomes competent:\nAI is taught by consuming billions of information points from both organized and unstructured sources, like blogs and news articles. The AI enhances its understanding to “comprehend” cybersecurity threats and cyber danger through machine teaching and profound thinking methods.\nAI Amplifies:\nAI eliminates time-consuming study assignments and offers an organized risk assessment, decreasing the quantity of time taken by security experts to create critical choices and help launch a structured reaction to remedy the danger.\nFor businesses wishing to incorporate AI into their cyber safety approach, the number of security experts they should maintain as employees varies based on the magnitude and range of their activities.

In 1994, Python managed to hold the 21st position. Then, with the passing years, its demand has kept on increasing. In 2019, it holds the 3rd position in the TIOBE index for programming languages.\n6. Future traffic of Python will overtake the other popular programming languages.\nAccording to Stack Overflow predictions, Python will continue to lead. The traffic of Python tags will be higher than other popular programming languages, such as Java, JavaScript, PHP, C, and C++. They have also predicted that Java and JavaScript will have a similar amount of traffic that they have from the last 2 years.\nConclusion\nPython has shown amazing growth in the last few years. But we are not looking to come up with any “language war”. Every programming language has its own pros and cons. There are some challenges in the Python language that can be addressed by other programming languages such as Java, JavaScript, etc., and vice versa. The purpose of this article is to let you know how the developer ecosystem has changed over the years and how Python has emerged as a popular and versatile programming language.

    "extractedText": "How Validation Testing Can Enhance Your Customer Satisfaction\nVedant Vyas\nRead more posts by this author.\nVEDANT VYAS\n15 NOV 2022 • 3 MIN READ\nLike any product, software undergoes a development process to prepare it for consumer use. Validation testing in software development confirms an application’s been built to meet a user’s needs and functions as anticipated. Whether you’re new to validation testing or want to be sure you’re on the right track with your validating process, this post will help ensure you meet your client’s requirements.\nValidation Testing - Software Verification vs. Software Validation\nSoftware testing examines software’s functionality and behavior through verification and validation. Though people often use the terms interchangeably, they are distinct processes:\nVerification determines if the software meets various, specific requirements. It’s performed at every stage of the development life cycle and ensures code logic is aligned with product specifications.\nValidation checks to see if the end product meets the client’s needs and desires. It’s typically conducted at the end of the software development process and focuses solely on output; that is, it doesn’t concern itself with internal processes or technical intricacies.\nIn short, validation testing is a one-time process that begins only after all verifications are complete. Software development teams use various validation methods, including functional and non-functional testing or structural/design testing.\nWhy Software Validation Testing Matters\nAll software development models require code review to ensure the product both works as intended and doesn’t contain bugs, defects, or errors.\nA software validation test guarantees the final product is ready for release and meets a customer’s expectations, so it’s important to get it right. Particularly as nearly 70% of consumers say a bad app experience will make them abandon it altogether. But how do you know if you’re doing it right, and when do you know it’s done?\nLet’s break down the different phases and techniques.\n1. Design qualification\nDesign qualification (DQ) occurs before product launch. It includes creating a list of end-user business requirements, designing a validation testing plan, and seeking approval from managers or shareholders before the testing process begins.\n2. Installation qualification\nInstallation qualification (IQ) entails installing the software according to the validation testing plan. The software development team might ensure that the system hardware and the installation process itself match the design specifications. They also confirm that the test environment is suitable for product operation and matches the environment in which the product is likely to perform once it’s released.\n3. Operational qualification\nDuring operational qualification (OQ), the development team uses various operations to test the product and ensure it meets specified user requirements. Essential techniques include unit, integration, and system testing, each of which helps determine if different elements of the software function according to user requirements.\n4. Performance qualification\nTo verify a product can perform according to its real-world needs, development teams conduct performance qualification or PQ testing. Developers might also perform alpha testing to assess the software’s functionality under simulated real-world conditions. In addition, clients are often offered the opportunity to test the product through a process known as beta testing, where they use the product themselves and identify any bugs or technical challenges.\nSometimes the validation process includes functionality testing such as:\nUnit testing to search for bugs in different segments.\nIntegration testing (aka string testing or thread testing) to test interfaces and flow of data.\nSystem testing to evaluate end-to-end specifications.\nOnce all validation testing phases are complete, the software product can go into production and be marketed and sold to consumers. If a major technical bug is subsequently discovered, the development team can address it by developing and releasing one or more software updates.\nUltimately, software validation testing helps reduce the chance of product failure and improves the reliability of the end product.\nDifferent software development methods use verification and validation in different ways. For instance, in agile development, the two happen simultaneously, as there’s a need for continuous refinement based on end-user feedback.\nWhile no application is entirely bug-free, Zibtek’s verification and testing process is designed to help you achieve your software development goals and fulfill all stakeholders’ expectations with minimal defects. Since 2009, our clients have depended on us to deliver software products that suit their unique needs and help them accomplish their business goals. Ready to learn more?

    "extractedText": "Hiring a Java Development Company: A Step-by-Step Guide\nVedant Vyas\nRead more posts by this author.\nVEDANT VYAS\n10 APR 2023 • 6 MIN READ\nAre you in search of a good Java development outsourcing company but don’t know where to start? We understand. There are so many Java app development “experts” on the market that the idea of choosing one can make your head spin.\nAnd that’s a shame, because second-guessing yourself and feeling indecisive right from the start is no way to begin the software development process. So, let’s dial things back for a minute and try to get everyone in a lighter frame of mind over all things Java.\nFor instance, did you know that Java was invented by accident? Yep, one of the most popular programming languages ever came into being when Canadian computer scientist and Sun Microsystems VP James Gosling and his team were cleaning up C++ and realized they had created a new way for developers to “write once, run anywhere.”\nOther fun Java facts include:\n· Gosling originally called the language “Oak” after a tree outside his office.\n· The switch to Java happened when the creators realized all their best ideas were being hatched at a local coffee shop.\n· The language’s famous waving mascot, Duke, was the brainchild of one of the team’s graphic artists, Joe Palrang, who went on to work as an animator on films like Shrek. In 2019, the mascot’s new personality, “Cloud Surfer Duke” was introduced.\nToday, Java is downloaded about a billion times a year, and there are over 9 million Java developers globally—that’s more people than live in New York City! And while Python recently topped Java as the world’s most popular programming language, there are plenty of good reasons to choose Java for your application.\nHiring a Java Development Company: A Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is Java?\nJava is sometimes called the “old fast grandpa” of programming languages. That’s actually a compliment, because it means its years of existence have allowed it to create libraries for nearly any task. You can find it in operating systems on your smartphone and watch, and it can even be hidden inside your desktop. From hit games to integrated development environments, it’s prized for making back-end development faster and smoother.\nThe past 27 years have seen 20 versions of Java released, and four platforms make up the language: Java Platform, Java SE, Java EE, and Java ME.\nReasons for its ongoing popularity include:\n1. It’s one of the best ways to build intelligent devices (Internet of Things).\n2. It’s the language of choice for Android mobile development.\n3. It’s one of the leading technologies for backend tasks like exchanging data and keeping software operations disruption-free.\n4. It’s cross-platform development ready.\nThat isn’t to say that Java can’t be used for front-end development, too. It’s just that it excels at ensuring server-side needs work efficiently with no errors.\nWho Uses Java?\nYou’ll find Java environments on all sorts of devices big and small. It gives Java developers a lot of flexibility for treating code as agnostic to the system on which it runs. Combine that platform independence with high-level security features and simplicity of use, and it’s easy to see why companies like Netflix, Spotify, and NASA choose the versatile language for business software and consumer apps alike.\nFinance\nMorgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan Chase all rely on Java to create convenient banking apps and automate financial processes. So, too, do the New York and London Stock Exchanges. It’s a great tool for simplifying a customer’s online bill paying and offers a secure way to use their digital wallets in-store.\nHealthcare\nJava is widely used in healthcare for diagnostic systems, record-keeping, and various server and web applications. If you’re designing a mobile app for your business or facility, using Java ensures native performance reliability.\nManufacturing\nIndustrial users choose Java to unlock the power of automation and make their businesses more profitable and successful. In today’s environment, a manufacturer’s growth is directly tied to its ability to integrate its many systems, including machinery, equipment, and other processes. Java excels at helping businesses process and control systems in an integrated way so they can achieve their business objectives, even when they evolve or change.\nEducation\nBecause Java is a universal general-purpose programming language, it can be used to develop desktop and mobile apps, embedded systems, and more that work no matter which device is used. Systems like Canvas, Blackboard, and Moodle are just a few examples of software that makes it easier for students to learn remotely, in the classroom, or in a hybrid environment.\nOther industries that rely on Java include aerospace and defense, entertainment, government, energy, and automotive.\nBut don’t walk away from these examples thinking Java is only suitable for large enterprises. There are plenty of advantages to applying it to small business projects as well. For instance, it can quickly accommodate many users as your digital efforts expand. And it offers nearly limitless possibilities for finding the perfect Java development company for your specific needs.\nHiring a Java Development Company: A Step-by-Step Guide\nWhy Should I Hire a Java Development Company?\nA better question might be, why shouldn’t you hire a Java development company? We’ve outlined a lot of the benefits of choosing Java for your next software build.\nBut since the question is why your SMB should hire a Java development company, here’s our view:\n· It’s great for creating revenue-generating apps in a short time.\n· Java-based solutions are celebrated for their speed, performance, and innovative features.\n· Its scalability and portability make it possible for engineers to work in a variety of situations and on various systems.\n· Java’s rigorous testing capabilities allow for exhaustive reviews of your software’s functionality.\n· Its robust security protects your business from cyber threats and breaches.\nA Java software application’s quality depends significantly on the developer’s skills. When you outsource your Java development, you’re assured of working with an experienced team of developers who, as a rule, have a higher success rate than when you only use your in-house team.\nStep-by-Step Guide for Hiring a Custom Java Development Company\nWe opened this post with the warning that plenty of Java “experts” are out there eagerly pursuing your business. It’s crucial to identify if the Java development company you’re considering has a team with the skill sets that best meet your company’s needs.\nHere’s a short list of what to look for in Java programmers and development companies.\n1. A good cultural fit. Does the company’s mindset match your business’s culture? You want a provider that can quickly transition into becoming a team player.\n2. Excellent problem-solving skills. Your Java developers should be proficient in writing, deploying, and managing code and be able to resolve issues quickly as they arise.\n3. Java specialization. Does your candidate have the necessary abilities and tech knowledge to perform core Java principles? Does it understand or have experience with your industry and its users? If it doesn’t, factor in a period of research and learning.\nSkilled Java developers are in high demand, so finding one in your area who meets all your requirements can be challenging. Outsourcing is a streamlined and affordable way to get the services you need for your Java project.\nWhy Hire Zibtek’s Java Developers?\nBusinesses have two options to use Java in their custom application development process:\n1. Use in-house resources.\n2. Outsource to a Java development company.\nWhen you choose Zibtek’s developers for your Java project, you get a wealth of benefits in return, including highly skilled engineers that, in the long run, save you a boatload of time and money that would otherwise be expended on in-house recruiting or training.

    "extractedText": "5 Outsourced Companies That Might Surprise You\nVedant Vyas\nRead more posts by this author.\nVEDANT VYAS\n3 APR 2022 • 4 MIN READ\nWhen people think about outsourced companies, they tend to focus on small to mid-sized businesses that don’t have the internal resources to accomplish business goals like software and app development. Yet, some of the world’s largest and most successful companies put their trust in the software development outsourcing process to:\nLower costs\nSave time\nAccess high-quality talent with diverse skillsets\nSpeed up development and launch time\nFor these brands, the flexibility and scalability of outsourcing are central to innovation and growth. Let’s look at how some highly-successful companies have used outsourcing for software development.\nOutsourced Companies\n1. Slack\nIt may be best known as one of the most widely used workplace communication services, but Slack’s also a terrific example of what happens when you outsource app design. The company outsourced its logo creation, marketing site design, and web and mobile apps development to a Canadian-based agency and reaped the rewards of a streamlined and beautiful product.\nOutsourced companies like Slack prove that hiring outside talent isn’t just for minor business strategies. By outsourcing critical business elements like app and web design, the communications giant could better establish and refine the essential components of its organization goals. From its playful interface to its unmistakable logo, the company has changed how corporations everywhere handle internal communications.\n2. Google\nYep, the “King of the Internet” has also outsourced some of its software development. While that might come as a surprise considering Google’s nearly 28,000 in-house developers, the company is actually a prime example of how intelligent outsourcing can help brands take advantage of key growth opportunities.\nGoogle’s outsourced projects tend to be those that call for continuous, cost-effective deployment. The company’s outsourcing journey began way back in 2011 when it used global call centers to fill a thousand AdWords support jobs. The move allowed Google to continue deploying customer support while its core team focused on innovations that could make AdWords stronger.\n3. Alibaba\nWith a reported 1.28 billion users at home and overseas, “China’s eBay” was an early adopter of outsourcing. In 1999, Jack Ma decided to outsource the company’s web development to appeal to a bilingual audience. By localizing its website for both Chinese and English audiences, the retail heavyweight established itself as a multinational business and accelerated its current success. The brand’s strategy highlights the substantial advantage software outsourcing can offer, particularly in branding a company for local audiences. Not only did Alibaba save resources and time with its outsourcing strategy, but it set the company up to appeal to both native and foreign audiences.\n4. GitHub\nGitHub is synonymous with software development, but many people inside and outside the industry don’t realize an outsourced developer actually designed it. Back in the days before GitHub became the site where 73 million developers shape the future of software, the company needed a website developer. But it had limited funds and couldn’t afford an in-house team.\nAt a San Francisco Ruby on Rails meetup, Scott Chacon, one-time CIO of GitHub, met with GitHub's now former CEO, Chris Wanstrath. Though Wanstrath lacked the financial resources to bring on Chacon full-time, he was impressed with his knowledge of Gits. So, the company hired Chacon as a freelancer to write Gist, GitHub’s sharing feature.\nThe take-away here? Outsourced companies that begin their third-party development journeys as cost-effective measures often discover the strategy can also drive innovation, giving them access to top talent at an affordable price.\n5. WhatsApp\nWhen WhatsApp launched in January 2009, it had 35 employees. Yet it soon became one of the most popular instant messaging and voice-over-IP services worldwide and in 2014 was acquired by Facebook for $19 billion. Before that happy ending, though, WhatsApp relied heavily on outsourcing software development. It hired outside teams to develop the earliest version of the platform and, along the way, minimized operational costs without sacrificing access to highly-skilled developers. Today, it is the third most downloaded Android app in the world, with more than 2 billion users who exchange 100 billion messages daily.\nOther successful tech companies that outsource software development include London-based telecom company Lebara, Israel’s messaging app Viber, and California-based Cirrus Insight, a customer relationship management firm.\nOutsourcing Software Development For Innovation & Growth\nCompanies of all sizes can realize significant benefits from outsourcing their software development, including fresh perspectives and novel ideas. Outsourced development teams can also save you money and enhance product quality, but only if you choose the right software development partner. Zibtek provides exceptional software development services for our clients, allowing them to scale up and down according to their unique requirements.\nIf you want to learn more about outsourcing’s benefits, or if you have a custom app project you’re looking to launch in the near future, we’d love to hear from you!

That's why so many companies actively consider it these days. It allows them to be more flexible with their development work and also to reduce costs over a longer period.\nThe great thing about outsourcing work is that it enables companies to have much more done in a relatively short time. They don’t have to rely entirely on their in-house development team for all of the work.\nThe in-house team could be dedicated solely to high priority tasks while the more routine matters can be outsourced. This frees them up also and allows the company to focus entirely on the goals that are best in line with their business objectives.\nOutsourcing is a great way forward for companies that don’t have their in-house development team. Nothing is preventing them from getting a full-fledged app or service built without ever bringing on a full-time resource on their company payroll.\nWhat does it mean to outsource development?\nAt its core, software outsourcing is an arrangement in which a company that requires development work hires a third-party software development firm to do the work for them. They select the development partner that they feel is most suitable for the kind of work that they’re looking to get done.\nThe project is then handed off entirely to the external team. This can be done at any stage. The external team could be responsible for building and executing the project from scratch or they can be brought in at a later stage to speed up the development work so that the deadlines can be met.\nIt's now much easier to tap into the software outsourcing marketplace than ever before. There's no shortage of software development firms and even highly experienced freelancers that can take on the responsibilities. Advanced communication tools make it easy to keep track of the work so the clients can always remain in the loop.\nDevelopers consistently rate Java as the top programming language because of its versatility, security, speed, and scalability. Java is utilized by some of the world's largest companies for the backend of their websites, desktop applications, and more. Java is also utilized in many Android applications.\nJava outsourcing explained\nJava is one of the most popular and versatile programming languages in use today. Its flexibility and cross-platform compatibility are some of the major reasons why it’s so popular. Developers can create high-quality applications with Java for a variety of industries.\nJava is also considered to be one of the most ideal technologies for outsourcing projects. That's primarily due to its ubiquity as well as its stability. That's in addition to the fact that it can be used to create large, distributed applications that can easily be scaled up.\nCompanies that are interested in Java outsourcing are often on the lookout for highly skilled engineers. There's an abundance of experienced developers that know Java like the back of their hand.\nAs they're located all across the globe, outsourcing enables companies to take advantage of the relative cost differences that service providers located in other parts of the world have to reduce their costs at home.\n8 key advantages of outsourcing Java development\nCost reductions\nOutsourcing development work is already one of the best ways for a company to reduce its expenses. When working with third-party developers, they don’t have to worry about paying them the market rate for salaries, providing them with office space, investing in new equipment, and offering other perks that would help them retain their skilled employees.\nThey only need to arrange as regards the service fee for the projects that they need help with. It’s a lump-sum arrangement in most cases whereby the external developers contracted for the work complete the task for the agreed-upon price.\nQuality guarantee\nSince the Java outsourcing market is so competitive, most developers that compete for business offer quality guarantees. They know that clients are looking for exceptional work and that they want the best possible return on their investment.\nThis competition benefits clients that outsource Java development work. They can choose from the countless service providers in the market and work with those that they feel are best suited to their project.\nAccess to a dedicated team\nFor larger projects, companies prefer that service providers assign them a dedicated team of Java developers. Clients can thus have a single point of communication and effectively monitor the work that’s being done as there’s no regular personnel change.\nThey only need to onboard the dedicated team once and that forms a solid foundation for them to work off of.\nOngoing support\nEven if a company chooses to utilize its in-house development team to complete work on the project, they can outsource the ongoing support to an external team. This frees up their in-house team from having to perform routine maintenance and system checks.\nAll of that can be handled by the external team so that the internal team can then focus on new projects, ones that further the company’s business objectives.\nExpansion of core team\nScaling up the in-house team often presents its own set of challenges. Hiring new resources is both a time consuming and resource-intensive task. Outsourcing work to third-party development work is a great way of enhancing the strength of the team, even if the additional resources are only required for a limited time.\nThis expansion comes at a lower cost because the additional resources need not be retained when they’re no longer required.\nRound-the-clock communication\nMost companies worry about the effectiveness of communication between them and the company that they outsource Java development work to. However, most professional development service providers strive to offer round-the-clock seamless communication to their clients.\nEnhance focus on core operations\nAs a business scales up and the size of its tech stack increases, it often happens that the focus starts to move away from the core operations. The business continues to burn time and resources without investing in new avenues of growth.\nHaving an external development team can help relieve a major part of that burden. This frees up the company to focus on its core operations as it has the peace of mind that skilled professionals are looking after existing projects.\nReduce time to market\nBusinesses must get their products out to market in time. There can often be situations where the delivery deadlines need to be pushed back. Such disruption can’t be afforded and most businesses strive to always reduce their time to market.\nRelying on third-party Java developers can help reduce time to market for products. Skilled resources can be brought on board quickly to help at any stage. Any gremlins that may exist are thus sorted out and the possibility of a delay is averted.\nThe benefits of outsourcing Java developers\nThe benefits of outsourcing work to Java developers far outweighs any concerns that people who are new to this may have. While it may feel daunting to hand off the project to people who may not seem to have a stake in the matter, it’s one of the most effective ways of getting the work done on time.\nAs previously explained, since Java is one of the world’s most popular programming languages, there’s no shortage in the market of highly skilled developers. Since there are so many, it increases competition and competition is always a great way to bring prices down.\nWith so many developers and firms competing for your business, you can get high-quality work done for far less than it might cost you to hire an entire in-house development team.\nChoose Zibtek for your Java outsourcing needs\nDon’t know where to find the best Java outsourcing partner?

Shocking! In today's interconnected digital landscape, your applications serve as the gateway to your organization's most valuable assets. Just as a medieval castle relies on sturdy walls, fortified gates, and vigilant guards to protect against external threats, your applications require robust security measures to defend against malicious attacks and unauthorized access. At Zibtek, we understand that safeguarding your digital fortress is paramount to preserving the integrity of your business. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the essential components of application security and provide actionable insights to help you fortify your defenses.\nWhat is application security:\nApplication security is the proactive safeguarding of software applications against potential cyber threats and vulnerabilities. At its core, it involves implementing robust measures and protocols to protect digital assets, user data, and sensitive information from unauthorized access, breaches, and malicious attacks. By prioritizing application security, businesses can ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of their systems, fostering trust with customers and mitigating risks associated with cybersecurity threats.\nExamples of Application Security: Example 1: Authentication and Authorization - Building a Strong Foundation\nImagine your application as a medieval castle, with each user representing a visitor seeking entry. Authentication acts as the castle's gatekeeper, verifying the identity of each visitor before granting access. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) serves as the castle's moat, adding an extra layer of protection by requiring visitors to provide multiple forms of identification. Once inside, authorization dictates which areas of the castle each visitor can access based on their roles and privileges, ensuring that sensitive areas remain off-limits to unauthorized individuals.\nExample 2: Mitigating OWASP Top 10 Threats - Battling the Siege Engines\nJust as medieval castles faced relentless attacks from siege engines and battering rams, modern applications are besieged by a barrage of cyber threats outlined in the OWASP Top 10. Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks are akin to enemy archers firing arrows through the castle's arrow slits, exploiting vulnerabilities in client-side scripts to inject malicious code. SQL injection, on the other hand, is akin to enemy soldiers tunneling beneath the castle walls, exploiting weaknesses in database queries to gain unauthorized access. By fortifying your applications with robust defenses like input validation, output encoding, and secure coding practices, you can repel these attacks and keep your digital fortress secure.\nExample 3: Securing APIs and Session Management - Protecting the Inner Keep\nJust as the inner keep of a castle houses the most valuable treasures and artifacts, your application's APIs and session management systems contain critical assets that must be protected at all costs. APIs serve as the drawbridge connecting your application to external systems, while session management ensures that each user's visit is securely tracked and managed.

    "extractedText": "Node.js Development: What it is and Why You Want To Use It\nVedant Vyas\nRead more posts by this author.\nVEDANT VYAS\n2 JUN 2022 • 4 MIN READ\nNode.js development is used by some of the most prominent players in global business, including PayPal, Netflix, and LinkedIn, to develop real-time applications, high-traffic sites, and IoT devices. But many people still aren’t clear on how it works, the pros and cons of using it, or how it delivers tangible business results. If you’re one of them, this article’s for you.\nThough it isn’t the right choice for every project, there’s gotta be some good reasons why it’s one of the top two frameworks, libraries, and programming languages developers prefer today. Let’s take a closer look.\nWhat is Node.js?\nTechnically, Node.js isn’t a framework at all. It’s an open-source server environment that runs on platforms using JavaScript. First released in 2009, its popularity is greater than ever.\nNode.js has several core elements:\nIts engine. Node.js development is based on the Google Chrome V8 JavaScript engine, making it incredibly lightweight, efficient, and fast for code execution. It is often paired with angularjs development on the front end.\nEvent-driven architecture. Rather than create multiple threads for every request, or wait for a request to finish before starting another, Node.js runs on a single thread and launches multiple simultaneous requests.\nNode package monitor. Unlike other tools, Node.js isn’t supported by SQL. Rather, its support comes from a document-based database model with the planet’s largest open-source library registry. Developers with access to Node.js’ Node Package Monitor or NPM can easily reuse codes to build apps more quickly.\nNode.js Development: Advantages and Disadvantages\nNode.js has become the go-to choice for many industries that love how extremely simple, cost-effective, and efficient it makes the development process. But like every tech tool, it has its pros and cons.\nStill on the fence about whether Node.js is suitable for your software development project? Here’s a brief walkthrough of its advantages and disadvantages and how it could add value to your projects.\nThe Upside to Node.js\nMany developers see Node.js as a sort of knight in shining armor, saving their web and mobile apps with its powerful and flexible nature. They point to its many benefits, such as:\nHigh performance for real-time applications, displaying results in the blink of an eye.\nEasy scalability for modern apps with cutting-edge technology that comes with tons of features like a cluster module and a non-blocking event-loop mechanism.\nCost-effectiveness with full-stack JavaScript. Developers can write codes on both the front and back ends with absolute ease.\nCommunity support, with millions of developers contributing insights that simplify development.\nEasy to learn and quick to adapt.\nHelps build cross-functional teams. With its full-stack development capability, Node.js makes it easier to build a team that’s focused on enhancing the development lifecycle.\nImproves app response time and boosts performance. When Netflix decided to switch from Java and JavaScript to Node.js, the streaming giant dramatically reduced its start-up time from 40 minutes to under 60 seconds!\nReduces time-to-market. Because Node.js is so lightweight, developers benefit from an accelerated overall development speed.\nExtensibility to meet custom requirements. Node.js uses a built-in API to develop HTTP and DNS servers and the JSON data format.\nReduced load times. Quick caching makes it easy for developers to reduce task workloads and re-execute code.\nHelps build cross-platform apps. Developers can use Node.js to leverage platforms to build cross-platform real-time web apps, meaning there’s no need to invest time in writing separate codes for various desktop versions like Windows, macOS, and Linux.\nWhile it works well for a variety of projects, Node.js development is especially effective for data-intensive real-time apps, high-traffic apps, and the IoT. It’s also good for apps that expect huge traffic loads that process large numbers of requests on the client-side.\nNode.js Downsides\nThe benefits of Node.js are far more numerous than its drawbacks, but they do exist.\nReduced performance when handling heavy computing tasks. And though Node.js introduced “worker threads” in 2018 to solve the problem, developers still are entirely equipped to deal with CPU-bound computation challenges.\nHeavy code changes from an unstable API. Developers consider the frequent API changes in Node.js as one of its most significant disadvantages.\nAn asynchronous programming model makes it difficult to maintain code.\nNot enough experienced Node.js developers to meet growing market needs.\nSituations where you shouldn’t use Node.js include image and graphics processing or video and audio editing. It’s also not the best choice for AI or machine learning, and it’s been known to overcomplicate the development of simple apps that transfer data directly from a server.\nWhen to Use Node.js\nIt’s apparent that Node.js plays a critical role in developing scalable, high-performing applications. Most developers love putting node.js’ advantages of performance, scale, and speed, to good use, and so do the clients they work with.\nIf you’re still not certain that Node.js can be beneficial to your next project, you may want to engage with a nodejs development company.\nSpeak to an expert now LinkedIn Twitter Email"

    "extractedText": "The Amazing Benefits of iOS Mobile App Development For Your Business\nVedant Vyas\nRead more posts by this author.\nVEDANT VYAS\n14 SEP 2021 • 4 MIN READ\nThe core of today’s business technology, iOS mobile app development offers incredible benefits to businesses of all sizes. While Android apps also have their advantages, there are compelling reasons why releasing your business app primarily on iOS can be more beneficial. Zibtek helps businesses in various industries build new technical capabilities, improve customer relationships, and enter new markets, all through custom iOS app solutions.\niOS Mobile App Development: Choosing the Right Programming Language\nThere are more than 600 programming languages now in use, and each has its pros and cons. Choosing the best programming language is essential to the software meeting your customers’ needs as you envision, now and in the future.\nHere are the four programming languages developers most often use in iOS mobile app development, with each having its distinct capabilities and benefits.\nObjective-C\nLong considered the essential iOS app programming language, Objective-C is known for building powerful, scalable apps. Its numerous functions precisely deal with graphics, I/O, and display functions and, as a piece of the Apple development framework, the language is fully integrated into all iOS and MacOS frameworks. In use since 1984, Objective-C is gradually being replaced in the Apple ecosystem by the more powerful Swift language.\nSwift\nYears in the making, Swift helps developers build great-looking apps across all Apple platforms using as little code as possible. A state-of-the-art programming language, Swift was created to work alongside Objective-C. User-friendly, it’s sued or developing cutting-edge iOS mobile apps for phones, desktops, servers, and more. Fast and safe, it combines the best in modern language thinking with Apple’s engineering culture and contributions from its open-source community.\nHTML5\nAn ideal programming language for building Web-fronted apps for mobile devices, HTML5 is the latest HTML version. Because it’s supported in many different ways by many different browsers, HTML5 has the advantage of building on the current version of HTML, which makes the learning curve much flatter than for completely new languages.\nDevelopers typically use HTML5 in combination with CSS and JavaScript. When used with tools such as Apache Cordova or React for Mac, it’s also possible to use the language to develop iOS apps. Though it’s a cost-effective choice, it doesn’t allow for building native apps and needs modern browsers to access it.\nJava\nAn object-oriented, class-based, and general purpose programming language, Java is one of the most preferred languages for Android app development. It can be run in two different ways: in a browser window or a virtual machine. While Java isn’t used for dedicated iOS mobile app development, it is used for developing cross-platform mobile applications.\nHow iOS Mobile App Development Benefits Your Business\nMobile apps are projected to generate over $935 billion in revenue by 2023. While games are the most popular Apple App Store category, business apps rank second. Today, it’s inconceivable to imagine anyone with a smartphone or tablet not having a multitude of mobile apps on them.\nBusinesses looking to capture market share in apps have plenty of reasons to invest in iOS mobile app development, as the iPhone’s reach and penetration are unsurpassed. Here are just a few of the benefits of iOS app development.\nGreater revenue. Despite having less of the smartphone market compared to Android, Apple manages to prevail when it comes to customer spending. Apple users are far more willing and likely to pay on an app than Android users.\nHigh security standards. Malicious attacks on mobile devices can have profound implications. iOS apps offer a high-end security layer and protect users against security threats like viruses, hacking, phishing, and breaches.\nIncredible customer experiences. A superior user experience is paramount in any business’s customer experience strategy. iOS apps work seamlessly on any compatible device, providing the exceptional customer experiences that are key to your company’s success and growth.\nTech-savvy audiences. Attracting new customers is vital to boosting revenue. Apple products have long been the preferred choice of Millennials and Generation Z, two highly desirable demographics. Developing iOS mobile apps is an innovative way to enhance your brand’s image and build your customer base.\nHigh ROI. Apps that make it onto the App Store go through rigorous testing to meet Apple’s high standards. People tend to trust iOS apps and the companies who create them, which can help generate higher revenues.\nLastly, iOS apps generally take around 25% less time to develop than Android apps with the same specifications.

    "extractedText": "PRACTICAL AGILE\nZibtek’s “Shift Left” Strategy: How to Increase Quality Assurance\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n7 MAR 2021 • 2 MIN READ\nWe’ve previously written about how important a team approach to sprint planning meetings can be. In the world of agile software development, that means getting Quality Assurance involved in sprint planning as well. Zibtek uses an agile strategy called “shift left” to push testing toward the early development stages. Testing early and often ensures a project has fewer bugs and improves code quality.\nShift Left vs. Traditional Testing\nTraditional waterfall software development projects see testing occurring immediately before product release. The inevitable bugs or usability issues uncovered could easily delay a project’s release until they are fixed. Testing becomes a bottleneck that seriously impedes the ability of projects to deliver on time.\nShift left testing simply moves some testing from the far right side of the software development process and “shifts” it back to an earlier time. It doesn’t mean moving all testing closer to a project’s beginning; it just means sprinkling it throughout each step and iteration.\nHow to Improve Quality Assurance?\nWhen using the shift left strategy at Zibtek, we have all our Quality Assurance people, whether they’re doing automated or manual, come to sprint planning meetings. While some think it’s a waste of time, experience has taught us it’s actually extremely valuable, because when QA team members are in the planning exercise:\nThey can walk through all the acceptance criteria and see what’s missing.\nThey know the edge cases or input values better than anyone, because they’ve been hammering them out.\nWe can start adding acceptance criteria based on what they bring to the table.\nIt’s also helpful because we talk about things like who owns the quality control measures in each story.\nEveryone’s a Sprint Team Member\nAt Zibtek, we don’t believe Quality Assurance is an individual or separate team. Instead, the whole sprint team, including the Devs, is QA. That’s why you’ll see everyone, including product owners (POs), doing some acceptance testing to ensure predefined requirements are met to mark a user story as complete. It’s a great way to catch things other team members might not have thought of or didn’t even know could be connected.\nOne of the greatest advantages to a shift left strategy is eliminating the “blame game” that’s so prevalent on other software development projects; the entire team owns quality. If everyone is Quality Assurance, no one gets to say, “hey, Quality Assurance didn’t find it.” When you build a culture from day one of “everyone’s in it together,” by the time you get to the end of the process, it will be faster because problems were discovered and fixed along the way.\nFor instance, there are times we may decide a ticket shouldn’t even go to QA. If the PO or Dev looked at it, we’re fine. So out of 10 tickets, we might have 2 or 3 of them that don’t need a QA step. That’s valuable to the project because it lets QA folks focus their time and attention on more difficult tickets and their automation efforts on things that are more complicated.\nFinally, because we now have all the acceptance criteria, we can start writing automation test cases, even before the code’s there. The tests are written knowing they’re going to fail (because there’s no code), but as code starts coming through, the tests start one-by-one to pass. That gives engineers real-time feedback as to what’s going on.If you want to learn more about the shift left strategy and how it can help you get the most out of your software development, contact us online today to schedule a consultation.

Clarity on potential variations, additional features, and scalability considerations is crucial. Transparent pricing not only prevents surprises but also fosters a trusting relationship. It's advisable to seek detailed estimates, ensuring that the proposed cost structure aligns with your budget constraints while maintaining a focus on delivering exceptional value.\nWhen considering the cost structure, it's essential to weigh the advantages and drawbacks of different pricing models. Agile and fixed pricing are two prevalent approaches, each suitable for distinct scenarios.\nAgile Pricing:\nPros:\nFlexibility: Agile allows for changes and adjustments during the development process, accommodating evolving project requirements.\nTransparency: Clients have continuous visibility into project progress, fostering collaboration and adaptability.\nEarly Deliverables: Regular iterations result in the early delivery of functional components, providing tangible outcomes throughout the project.\nCons:\nUncertain Final Cost: Due to the adaptable nature of agile, the final cost may be less predictable, potentially exceeding initial estimates.\nContinuous Involvement: Agile demands consistent client involvement and feedback throughout the project, which may require substantial time commitment.\nFixed Pricing:\nPros:\nPredictable Budget: Fixed pricing provides a clear and predetermined budget, offering stability and predictability.\nDefined Scope: The scope of work is clearly outlined at the project's outset, reducing the likelihood of unexpected changes.\nLimited Client Involvement: Clients can be less involved during the development process, requiring fewer time commitments.\nCons:\nLimited Flexibility: Fixed pricing can be less accommodating to changes or modifications during the development process.\nLate Deliverables: Clients may receive the final product only at the project's completion, with fewer interim deliverables.\nIn deciding between agile and fixed pricing, consider the nature of your project. Agile suits dynamic projects where requirements may evolve, while fixed pricing provides stability for well-defined projects with minimal anticipated changes. Understanding these pros and cons empowers you to choose the pricing model aligning with your project's unique characteristics and your preferred level of involvement and flexibility.\nHow to choose the right software development company for my project?\nCan I request a trial project or a smaller engagement before committing to a long-term partnership with a software programming company?\nYes, many software programming companies offer the option of a trial project or a smaller engagement before committing to a long-term partnership. This approach allows you to assess the company's capabilities, work methodology, and compatibility with your project requirements without the immediate commitment of a large-scale collaboration.\nA trial project serves as a practical demonstration of the software programming company's skills, providing tangible insights into their approach and the quality of their work. It offers an opportunity to gauge communication efficiency, adherence to timelines, and the overall working dynamics. This initial engagement ensures that both parties can evaluate the feasibility of a long-term partnership based on real-world collaboration experiences.\nWhat post-launch support can I expect from a software development company specializing in custom software programming?\nPost-launch support is a critical aspect of any software development project, especially in the realm of custom software programming. A reliable software development company should offer comprehensive post-launch support, encompassing various facets to ensure the ongoing success and functionality of your software.\nThis support typically includes bug fixes, addressing any issues that may arise after the software's deployment. Regular updates to keep the software aligned with evolving technological standards and security patches are crucial components of post-launch support. Additionally, ongoing maintenance, feature enhancements, and technical support contribute to a holistic post-launch support framework.\nBefore finalizing a partnership, it's advisable to discuss and clarify the extent and duration of post-launch support. This ensures that your custom software remains secure, up-to-date, and adaptable to changing business needs in the post-deployment phase. A transparent understanding of the post-launch support offered by the software development company is integral to the long-term success and sustainability of your custom software solution.\nEngage for Success: Catch the Wave of Software Success - Contact Us\nChoosing the right software development partner is not just a decision; it's a meaningful conversation.

It's essential to choose a partner with a track record of success, technical expertise, and a collaborative approach to problem-solving.\nOnce a partner is selected, businesses should prioritize clear communication and collaboration throughout the development process. This ensures that software solutions meet stakeholder expectations and deliver the desired outcomes.\nFurthermore, businesses should establish key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics to track the success of software development initiatives. Regular monitoring and evaluation allow businesses to identify areas for improvement and make data-driven decisions to drive continuous improvement.\nUltimately, strategic integration of software development requires a proactive and holistic approach. By aligning technology initiatives with business objectives, fostering collaboration and innovation, and investing in the right people and processes, businesses can maximize the impact of software development on transformational outcomes.\nHow can software development contribute to transforming a business?\nSoftware development isn't just about creating applications; it's about reshaping the very DNA of your business.

By embracing innovative technologies and agile methodologies, businesses can streamline operations, optimize processes, and deliver unparalleled value to customers. A strategic partnership with a trusted software development company empowers businesses to embark on this transformative journey, leveraging custom software solutions to stay ahead of the curve.\nConsider a manufacturing firm adopting IoT-enabled sensors and predictive analytics software to monitor equipment performance in real-time, minimize downtime, and optimize production processes. This not only improves operational efficiency but also enables proactive maintenance, reducing costs and enhancing competitiveness in the market.\nIn addition to operational enhancements, digital transformation through software development can also drive innovation and create new revenue streams for businesses. By embracing emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and blockchain, businesses can develop disruptive solutions, enter new markets, and differentiate themselves from competitors.\nMoreover, digital transformation enables businesses to better understand and engage with their customers. By leveraging data analytics and customer relationship management software, businesses can gain insights into customer behavior, preferences, and needs, allowing for personalized and targeted marketing campaigns, product recommendations, and customer service interactions.\nUltimately, digital transformation is not just about adopting new technologies—it's about reimagining business models, processes, and strategies to thrive in the digital age. By embracing digital transformation with software development at its core, businesses can future-proof themselves, drive innovation, and maintain a competitive edge in today's rapidly changing business landscape.\nExplain the impact of business transformation through software development?\nThe impact of business transformation through software development is profound and far-reaching. By investing in professional software development services, businesses can unlock new opportunities for growth, innovation, and market expansion.

    "extractedText": "ECOMMERCE\nCustom Magento Development Guide\nIan J.H Reynolds\nExplore Ian J.H Reynolds' expertise in finance and economics through his insightful articles on market trends, investment strategies, and economic analysis.\nMore posts by Ian J.H Reynolds.\nIAN J.H REYNOLDS\n28 DEC 2020 • 6 MIN READ\neCommerce has seen a rapid growth over the past decade. While it may not have seemed possible for a business to survive without a retail presence not too long ago, eCommerce has given businesses the opportunity to not only survive but thrive online.\nThere are many different platforms and frameworks available that can be utilized for setting up an eCommerce store. There are software-as-a-service platforms that provide business owners with a plug-and-play solution. Those who prefer a more customized approach can opt for more powerful and flexible platforms.\nWhat is Magento?\nMagento is one such platform. This eCommerce platform is built on open source technology and it provides online business owners with a flexible shopping cart system.\nIt also allows for exceptional customization so business owners can exercise complete control over the look, feel, and functionality of their store.\nWork on Magento started back in 2007 with the first public beta version being released in 2007. It quickly became one of the most popular eCommerce platforms. Even though it was acquired by Adobe in 2018, Magento's source code is still distributed under the Open Software License v3.0.\nMagento also strives to make the process simple and easy for users. The Page Builder allows store owners to create content with an easy-to-use interface.\nThey can personalize parts of the store for specific customers and also update pages quickly. Modern drag-and-drop tools make it all very easy to manage.\nThere are many out-of-the-box templates that online store owners can take advantage of to create their site. It also simplifies the order fulfillment process by enabling store owners to allow customers to both buy online or pick up in store.\nWhy choose Magento over other B2B eCommerce platforms?\nMagento is particularly preferred by B2B companies and it has proven its worth over the years as a flexible and reliable sales platform. It enables businesses to quickly develop their online stores and scale up to meet their requirements.\nIt also makes it easy to introduce new products and open up new sales channels. The platform's additional features provide an opportunity to offer customers great service.\nAdvantages\nOpen-source\nGiven the fact that Magento is an open-source platform, businesses don't have a high upfront cost just to use the platform. They can work with developers to create customization features for their online store due to the open-source nature of Magento.\nAdvanced functionality\nMagento offers a lot of functionality that other eCommerce platforms don't. This includes managed cloud services, DDoS protection, Varnish-based CDN, ability to scale globally with cloud delivery, manual data backup, infrastructure support, and more.\nThis eliminates the need to pay for third-party plugins as many other platforms require. For example, it's possible to set up multi-currency pricing, taxes, languages, discounts, and coupons without requiring additional software.\nCustomer groups\nCreating customer groups can be very useful in tracking both B2B and B2C sales. All businesses have different types of customers. Properly segmenting those customers makes it possible to further tailor the service.\nIt's possible to create different customer groups in Magento to which different settings can be applied. This can be done to influence the offer structure, price, and other variables.\nDisadvantages\nSeparate hosting\nA major disadvantage of the platform, which might be one of the reasons why small businesses just starting out may not consider it, is the fact that hosting is not included. Businesses that want to use Magento for their online store need to pay for the hosting separately.\nPaying for the hosting separately obviously adds another expense on top of things. However, many find this to be beneficial as they're able to choose the hosting environment themselves.\nCan end up being costly\nPricing for the Magento Commerce Starter plan starts at $1,600 per month. It's aimed at small B2C and B2B merchants that require flexibility. However, not all small businesses might be willing to put in that level of investment, even if they understand the benefits that Magento provides.\nThe Magento Commerce Pro plan can end up being even more expensive. There's no set pricing provided for this plan that's meant for established B2C and B2B merchants. Pricing for this plan is based on annual Gross Merchandise Value.\nCustomization is complex\nCreating highly customized solutions with Magento can be complex. As such, it’s not something that many people can do on their own without the assistance of custom Magento developers.\nAgain, this may not be the perfect solution for businesses that are just starting out and don’t necessarily have the resources to invest in custom development.\nCompanies and businesses that use Magento\nSEAT, a Volkswagen subsidiary, utilized the advanced Magento 2 platform to create a responsive and immersive website to sell cars online. The brand's customers are in the younger demographic that's mobile-savvy and always connected.\nTherefore, it needed an online presence that could cater to that demographic. The Magento implementation allowed SEAT to improve navigation and page load times on mobile devices in addition to significantly increasing the average duration of mobile sessions.\nQuebec-based fashion giant Marie Claire had more than 300 stores but no digital plan. It was only in 2015 that the brand decided to create an omnichannel experience for their four clothing brands, different loyalty programs, and all of their physical stores.\nThis transition ended up being a success. Marie Claire was able to convert their existing customers to omnichannel through the new digital experience. The brand saw its conversions increase by 40 percent while the average order value also surged by 30 percent.\nMonin is perhaps the most famous syrup brand in the world. The brand was able to increase its sales by more than 400% because of Magento. Monin had been running its online operations on Magento Commerce 1 since 2013. It saw its overall US eCommerce revenue increase by 53 percent in just four years.\nThe company decided to upgrade to Magento 2 in 2018 in order to increase efficiency and modernize the architecture. Once the upgrade was completed, Monin saw an increase in sales by as much as 400 percent.\nFrance's third-largest pharmaceutical laboratory, Pierre Fabre, migrated all of its four brands to Magento and ended up being regarded as one of the best eCommerce sites.\nThe company selected Magento cloud to bring their multiple brands on shared core infrastructure. The upgrade improved site performance and stability that repeat customers and high traffic require.\nPierre Fabre also added unique elements to their online store, including video storytelling and other rich content. After all four brands were migrated, the site performance increased by 30 percent year-over-year.\nThe company also saw an increase in conversions and average order value.\nHow much time does it take to build a custom Magento store?\nThe amount of time it will take to build a custom Magento store really depends on the nature of the work. It can take anywhere from one week to even a couple of years. This obviously doesn’t mean that developers won’t have an idea of the time it would take before they start working on the project.\nThe best custom Magento developers will first work with you to understand your vision for the project. They will then be able to provide you with an estimate of the time it would take to develop the store.\nObviously, the time required to create the custom store will depend on just how complex the work that needs to be done is.\nIf you only require a fairly straightforward custom store that doesn’t have a lot of additional functionality, then you probably expect it to be done in a short period of time.\nIf your online store has all the bells and whistles that one can expect from a highly complex implementation, then you can expect to wait longer for the work to be done.\nHow much does custom Magento development cost?\nThis is another variable that also depends on the nature of the work. The custom Magento developers that you work with will be able to provide you with an estimate of how much the development work is going to cost.\nIf the nature of the work is highly complex, it would require the developers to put a lot of resources into the project. This is going to result in a much higher cost.\nEven the simplest of custom Magento stores can cost a few thousand dollars to create at the very least. The cost can go up rapidly if more customization is needed or there’s a requirement for third-party integrations.\nZibtek is one of the world's leading software development companies. We have worked with both Fortune 500 companies and startups, helping them bring their vision to life.\nOur experts in custom Magento development can create highly customized solutions for you that fit your vision. We are based in the United States with offices in Salt Lake City, Utah.

    "extractedText": "BUSINESS\nHow To Create A High-Quality Blog Post That Your Readers Will Love\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n14 SEP 2018 • 4 MIN READ\nHelping your readers learn something new and interesting is paramount when you write a blog. If you just write random articles in an attempt to fill up the content on your website’s blog section, you won’t attract the traffic you want. Quality does matter when it comes to creating a blog. If you want to prove that you have authority in a subject, you should not forget this principle.\nEnsure that your blog is not boring; you don’t want to repeat the same concepts every other day. Always include something new and exciting when you are writing any blog post. It is one way you can stand out from the rest of the crowd and the only way you will be driving readers to your website. Blogs can inspire people when you include personal experiences and facts. If you are running a business, readers can increase their understanding of a particular product or service you offer by reading the blog.\nBlogs act as a gateway for the target audience to learn about your company. It will pave the path to make sales or in getting the leads that are necessary to further your business. Here are some fantastic tips and guidelines that can help you create high-quality blog posts that your readers will love reading.\n1. Have A Plan In Place\nIf you want to create fantastic blog posts that attract a lot of traffic on to your site, you need to have a plan. Having an editorial calendar will be helpful to you as you strategize different topics and keywords that you intend to focus on each week. Some writers randomly pick a topic and write hundreds of pages on a particular subject. This kind of writing is not helpful when you are planning to drive traffic to your site in order to boost ad revenue and sales.\nBesides picking a few topics, it is also essential to write down the sub-headings that you are going to concentrate on. By following this process, you will have a well-crafted outline with a clear target goal to reach the right audience.\n2. Use Brilliant Titles\nThe only way people will click on your blog is when they find it attractive. You need to invent impressive titles to achieve this goal. When you use boring titles, people will not be interested in clicking your post. The best weapon for your blog post success is catchy, brilliant and click-worthy titles.\nNo matter how impressive your blog post is, people do not stay concentrated for more than 20 minutes. The first connection that you will make with a reader is by using an excellent title. You will be able to draw your readers to your blog when you use this tactic.\n3. Organize Your Blog\nIf readers find your blog disorganized, they will move on immediately. After creating a post, it is necessary for you to take the time to review it to ensure that it is up to the mark. You may need to use writing software like Microsoft Word or choose Google Docs.\nAfter completing your first draft, take time to clean up and organize your post. When you review and polish the document thoroughly, it will be good enough to publish. One of the best tools available in the market that assists you in getting the grammar and syntax right is Grammarly. Using a tool like this will help you in enhancing the quality of your blog.\nHemmingway Editor is another tool that can help convey your message to the reader. If the readability grade is above 8, you need to work on simplifying it. An excellent blog will fall anywhere under the readability scale of 5 to 7. Readability grade is an indicator to you of the class of education that a person needs to understand the blog you have written. You need to ensure that these components are in the blog as appropriate:\nHeadings\nBullet Lists\nNumbered Lists\nMulti-level Lists\n3. Stick to the Truth\nIt is essential for you to deliver the truth to the readers. People want to read the facts and hence will not like content that is not trustworthy. The best way for you to show respect for your readers is by providing them with good quality and informative content. Always research the things that you are going to advocate on your blog. When you know and understand your subject, your credibility as a writer will increase.\n4. Increase the Quantity\nThere is a big debate on this particular subject as some say that the posts should have quality and quantity does not matter. But if you want to become a better and more efficient writer, you need to increase the number of posts you publish. When you begin to write lots of posts focusing on different things, your knowledge grows. The time you take to write a post will also decrease gradually. You will be in a much better position to draft blog posts more efficiently. It means you will have more time, which you can utilize to focus on other aspects of your business.\n5. Avoid Plagiarism\nIf you want your readers to trust you, you need to write content that is original. While you can base your ideas on other material that is available freely and readily on the internet, never copy sentences or phrases directly from those sites. Besides, losing credibility as a writer, you or your company can face dire consequences like losing PageRank in searches. Use software like Copyscape to ensure that your blog is free from plagiarism.\nThese are some tips that you need to follow if you want to create high-quality content for your blog. Following these tactics will assist in bringing a lot of traffic to your site. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

    "extractedText": "SOFTWARE\nIs Off-The-Shelf Software For You?\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n18 APR 2018 • 8 MIN READ\nIf you’ve got a new product idea that requires software you’ve probably researched off-the-shelf solutions. Some popular off-the-shelf products are Pipedrive, a CRM tool, or Shopify, an ecommerce tool. Many companies find buying off-the-shelf software to be a workaround to developing a custom solution; others believe that off-the-shelf software is harder to scale, as it may not integrate well with home-grown systems. In the buy vs. build dilemma, it’s difficult to make the right choice.\nStartups often find themselves between a rock and a hard place when it comes to making long-term vs. short-term decisions. On the one hand, as a startup with small amounts excess capital, it may be a good idea to take a conservative approach to costly business initiatives like software. On the other hand, investing in long-term systems with growth potential can be wise. So, how do CTO’s decide? They answer these two questions.\nCan custom software provide your company with a competitive advantage over your competition?\nCan you disperse the cost of a proprietary software over your large group of clientele?\nThe Argument for Custom Software\nAlways keep in mind that building custom software, either in-house or outsourced, requires team resources, time, and effort to be valuable. Because of the upfront resources that must be dedicated to custom software development to see it be successful, many startups shy away from this option. There can be several reasons, however, that make custom software a better fit.\nOut-of-the-box software simply cannot meet the needs of every implementation.\nThe rigidity of canned solutions can create more work as companies grow.\nA home-grown software can integrate with a broader set of APIs.\nScaling an out-of-the-box software solution can break existing efficiencies.\nMain Benefit: Start by building an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and scale up as needed. The MVP you build is completely customizable and tailored to your business.\nThe Argument for Off-the-Shelf Software\nCanned software solutions are without a doubt more cost effective. But is that reason enough to buy off-the-shelf software? Like anything else, it’s circumstantial, especially for startups.\nCustom solutions are costly because they are built to function exactly as the company needs. If budget is limited, a canned solution may be the only option.\nA team lacking technical chops may suffer when faced with an in-house build out or giving direction to an outsourced tech team, resulting in a subpar product.\nBusinesses/owners with limited bandwidth for providing the guidance needed to develop a proprietary product should opt for an off-the-shelf solution.\nSoftware that won’t create a competitive advantage. If custom software won’t provide the business with higher quality service or a lower cost product, it is not worth it.\nMain Benefit: SaaS means ready-made with no installation of hardware or software.\nMany companies have succeeded and failed with both custom software and off-the-shelf software. As it turns out, it’s more important that what the company offers is useful to its consumers than whether or not it has custom software. Your company’s choice to build or buy will be based on many of the factors mentioned above and more from your perspective. Be cognizant of where your business is at financially, what systems are working, and develop your plans for growth before you move forward with either option.\nWhether you’ve decided to buy or build, you might still need a developer. If you’ve thought about outsourcing but still have some hesitation, then this one is for you.\nThe Pros and Cons of “Off-the-shelf” Software\nAccording to a recent survey by IBISworld, $59.3 billion in revenue will be generated in the US for business and enterprise software this year.\nCompanies are spending money on this type of software because it has become critical to their success. Tools like Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems, Project Management, Marketing Automation, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), and Accounting packages are being joined by data mining, artificial intelligence, and Business Intelligence (BI) solutions to make organizations more efficient and effective. These tools are required to be competitive, and how well you implement them can be a significant driver in a company’s productivity.\nKnowing that these tools are essential is just the first step. To gain their full value, leadership must choose the right system of tools for their organization. That is where a choice comes in: choosing between existing “off-the-shelf” solutions from outside suppliers and creating your own custom solutions, or some hybrid between the two.\nAn excellent place to start in making that decision? Understand the positives and negatives of off-the-shelf software.\nOff-the-shelf is a term coined by the US Government to refer to items sold in large quantities by a commercial company. The term comes from the past practice of walking into a retail store to pick the product off a shelf and purchase it. We don’t go to stores for our software anymore, but we do have a wide variety of virtually packaged software solutions that people buy and use with no modification.\nExamples of off-the-shelf products include:\nMicrosoft Office\nG Suite\nSalesforce\nHubSpot\nJira\nOracle\nWordPress\nSkype\nA 2016 academic study revealed that about half of the business software investment by companies is on proprietary systems and half on off-the-shelf. They also found that companies plan to continue this trend through 2021.\nLet’s summarize those pros and cons, offer advice on how to understand the full cost, and provide you with some first steps your organization can take if you can’t find an existing solution, to have the advantages of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software with a custom-built solution.\nPros: The advantages of off-the-shelf software\nBefore jumping into how commercial tools can benefit your company, remember why business software is so critical to your organization: to drive more business and lower costs.\nIt can do this by automating a task, giving access to needed data, or by making employee tasks and business processes less painful. When looking at the advantages and disadvantages, keep this in mind for your company.\nHere are the five pros that we have seen in working with our customers:\nQuick implementation\nThere is no need to write code or plan strategies. Once you buy you get a complete solution allowing your team to start using it almost immediately\nNo up-front cost (and costs are well known and predictable)\nIn most cases, business software is now sold under the Software as a Service (SaaS) model. That means you pay a monthly or annual fee, which spreads out the cost of ownership over time into a predictable, recurring expense rather than a large lump sum for each new release of the software product. Note that, in this model, license fees can still apply.\nSupport from vendor and user community\nOff-the-shelf tools come with support and training from the company that wrote the software, and the user community for that tool. This comes with the software as part of the SaaS fees. The power of support from other users can be significant because they are facing the same issues your employees may encounter. Many also offer community support from their active, thriving user base.\nRegular updates and upgrades\nVendors regularly release new versions of their software that fix bugs or add functionality. As long as they have paying customers, they will continue to improve the tools they sell.\nQuality is handled by the vendor\nQuality assurance is a part of software development that end-users only notice when it is done poorly. With Off-the-shelf solutions, the significant effort to do QA is handled by the vendor.\nCons: The disadvantages of off-the-shelf software\nPurchasing a proven commercial solution comes with some negatives. Going back to the reason why you are investing in software, increase business and reduce costs, there are some obvious and hidden penalties with off-the-shelf tools.\nHere are the five that we see most often:\nDoes not match your business processes or specific needs\nThe primary reason why companies develop custom software tools for business is that commercial packages do not meet their unique needs (51%), and the processes that are presented are not efficient enough (53%).\nIntegration with other software is non-existent or difficult\nIntegration between tools is becoming better and more common—but it can still be difficult, and in some cases, non-existent! Because of this, organizations spend astronomical resources on in-house software developers creating data connections between products and data stores that often break with new releases.\nYou are dependent on someone else for features and maintenance\nThe second reason cited by companies for writing their own tools was that they needed to make enhancements (46%) not delivered by the vendor. With off-the-shelf systems, users are dependent upon the decisions of that vendor and the demands of the customers as a whole.\nCost over time can be considerable\nAlthough the initial cost for a commercial solution can be low, especially with SaaS, those payments do not go away over time and can be significant. The advantages of off-the-shelf solutions come at a price, and that price is a repeating fee that never goes away. Additional costs exist because of the customization needed to fit a generic solution into the processes and needs of your company.\nNo competitive advantage\nThis can become a large hidden cost. When you buy a piece of software that is available on the open market, every other user of that software has the same advantage you have. Any unique technology, breakthrough algorithm, or time-saving automation is shared with your competitors.\nCapturing the actual cost of proprietary software\nUnderstanding the pros and cons of off-the-shelf software is an important first step. The next task is to determine the full cost of purchasing an existing commercial solution over multiple years. The purchase price, implementation fees, training, and monthly SaaS fees are just one part of the equation.\nA great way to do this is with a risk-adjust value assessment of the off-the-shelf system. Or you can take a more fundamental approach of looking at the ROI by subtracting three types of costs and three categories of benefits:\n+ Value:\nIncreased Revenue generated through new customers, customer retention, and higher transaction values.\n+ Value:\nDecreased labor and infrastructure costs from improved efficiency and automation.\n- Cost:\nInitial and over time, external and internal\n- Cost:\nCompetitive and productivity advantage of having control over your critical software tools\n- Cost:\nLost productivity changing processes to fit or labor cost to customize a standard solution to address your needs.\nFull added cost or value\nEvery company’s ROI will be different, but the only way to really know the pros and cons of an off-the-shelf solution is to estimate the cost and value.\nGetting the advantages of off the shelf solutions in custom software\nWhen you add everything up, you may find yourself in the situation many companies face when they want the advantages of commercial software, but don’t overcome the downsides. That is where well-designed and implemented custom software applications can deliver.\nIn our opinion, the biggest downside of a proprietary solution is that it doesn’t do what you need or will force you to change your processes. Or, you may not want to share critical functionality with your competitors. In these cases, there’s a better way.\nDocument those needs, processes, and features, and then partner with a custom software development company that can deliver the solution you are looking for. You’ll get the functionality and almost all the advantages of off-the-shelf software.\nWith a great software development outsourcing partner, like Zibtek, you get more than a great development team. They replace the SaaS provider to deliver domain expertise, quality assurance, support, and regular upgrades and enhancements. All directed by your business needs instead of every potential user.\nIf you’re considering a bespoke software solution, or perhaps still aren’t sure about how an off-the-shelf software package might be better for your organization, reach out to us.\nWe’re experts in custom development, especially for ERP and CRM systems—but we’ll always point you in the direction we believe is best for your business, even if that’s a COTS product or another software vendor.\nTake advantage of our free consultation to help companies like yours determine their options.\nLove a Good Ebook?\nThen download this software development comparison guide to know about the many different software development models.

    "extractedText": "BUSINESS\nCyber Threat Intelligence\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n12 JUN 2019 • 4 MIN READ\nWhat is cyber threat intelligence?\nCyber threat intelligence (CTI) is collective information that an organization uses to comprehend the essence of the damage that the organization is experiencing. This data is also used to anticipate and either avoid or retaliate cyber attacks. With its capacity to understand profound data, risk intelligence offers you with context that allows you to generate informed decisions about your safety by reacting to issues. It also offers a blueprint for the motives of the intruder and their capacity to hurt the organisation, thus understanding their motives and limitations.\nWhy is threat intelligence important?\nThreat intelligence managers evaluate the data gathered to create suitable risk intelligence planning and feed records complete with only the most significant information that can be used to create safety choices for the business through integrated security control systems and governance. The basic aim of this type of safety is to help maintain businesses aware of sophisticated risks.\nThe greatest intelligence systems use machine learning to automate information compilation and handling. It also incorporates with your current solutions, combining unstructured data from different locations and linking the points results in offering background on indicators.\nThreat intelligence is often split into three sub-classifications:\nCritical: Outstretched trends specifically targeted to the non-technical group.\nTechnical: Outlines of risk performer strategies, methods and processes to a more technical group\nPractical: Technical information concerning particular assaults and campaigns\nWhy threat intelligence matters\nCost Reduction\nCyber-threatening information can reduce your general costs and save your company assets as enhanced defences mitigate the danger to an organization. The company not only faces data loss after a data breach, but it also has to bear many costs such as post-incident remediation and recovery, penalties, trial payment, inquiry expenses, harm to their credibility, business location and more.\nLowered Risk\nCyber criminals with intent or capacity to hurt others and organisations are continually investigating fresh methods of penetrating networks within organisations. Threat intelligence offers adequate exposure in such evolving safety risks to decrease the danger of information loss, minimize or prevent company disturbance, and achieve legislative approval.\nRescuing data\nWhen suspect IP addresses or databases attempt to interact with your network to retrieve significant data, a cyber risk intelligence scheme functions as a guard. Here, a threat intelligence scheme helps prevent or block delicate information from infiltrating the network and taking such addresses. These intrusions may transform into a dispersed rejection of business assault that causes severe harm to a scheme if not replied to in a moment.\nComprehensive threat investigation\nCyber threat investigators help organisations evaluate a cybercriminal’s unthinkable tactics. The organisation can determine if the safety protection mechanisms can prevent such an attack by examining such cyber attacks.\nServing while sharing\nSharing critical data about cybersecurity, such as how hackers schedule a safety violation, may assist others in avoiding such assaults, thereby reducing the number of assaults carried out by the intruders.\nNot every threat is made in a similar way, and if successful, not all threats would have the same impact on an organization. It is essential for businesses to be conscious of all future risks, but risk intelligence runs one stage further and enables businesses to dedicate safety funds to reinforce protections where needed to reinforce the safety posture against the assaults that are most probable to happen.\nWhat can your organization expect from a CTI?\nA whole view of your assets is required to manage threats. You need a program to monitor activity, identify issues, and provide the type of data you need to make calculated decisions to protect your business.\nMust haves in a CTI:\nModified threat management:\nYou want a CTI accessing your scheme, identifying weaknesses, suggesting safeguards and monitoring it round the clock. Many cybersecurity technologies pretend to do this, but you should seek one that is prepared to customize an issue to your requirements.\nInformation update:\nTo maintain an eye on prospective issues, you need up-to-date streamlined information about suspicious attackers & blacklisted pages.\nKnow it all:\nYou need a business that provides you links to its latest research showing how hackers get in, what they want, and how they received it. Companies can make more deliberate choices armed with the data.\nCyber Threat Intelligence Program Helpful Advice\nKnow more about your company or industry. Threat intelligence that is not important to your company, industry or workplace will exhaust your funds without yielding much-needed protection.\nDefine your objectives and concentrate highly on them from the start of the program. It’s difficult to cover everything. There’s always more data to gather, and you can’t just accept all.\nSomething that you can relate to:\nOrganizations often need to rapidly identify the danger and do not want to spend time researching false alerts, thereby remediating vulnerabilities and more quickly neutralizing the attack vector. The typical issues facing the safety application center are:\nHow could hackers target the capacities of my organization in the months ahead?\nWho are my main opponents? Are they trustworthy?\nCan I be notified of their operation within a short time after it takes place? Which subterranean places are they frequenting? Who is considered to be linked to these opponents?\nThe numbers of the Threat Intelligence Platform speak for themselves: study participants recognize the biggest advantages in enhancing their safety activities, detecting and preventing threats and assaults. Coordinating the use of CTI has proven to be of specific importance to 90 percent of customers, saying that it has enhanced the awareness of risks in their own network environment. Additionally, the precision and velocity of noise elimination enhanced in almost all instances.\nBusiness participants need to have a strong knowledge of the general risk scenario and their personal risk scenario to react appropriately at all moments.

The job isn’t done when the development work on your software is completed. Unless it’s properly deployed, the software isn’t going to be able to fulfill its intended purpose. That’s why software deployment is such an important part of the entire process.\nThe software deployment process\nThis isn’t just limited to the first installation of software. Any and all subsequent updates also have to go through the deployment process, otherwise, how can they be sent out to the users that are waiting for them?\nWhat is software deployment?\nThe different methods and processes utilized to make a system software available to the users can be collectively referred to as software deployment. However, it can mean some else entirely in the case of web development.\nAn update to your favorite website isn't sent out directly to visitors. The developers merely deploy their changes to a server which makes the update instantly accessible for any and all visitors to the website.\nAt its core, though, software deployment is simply the delivery of completed software to the customer who ordered it or to the consumers that are already using it.\nIt's one of the final stages of the development process since a software shouldn't be deployed until it has been thoroughly tested. This is done to ensure that there are no flaws or bugs in the code and if some are discovered during the testing phase, they're fixed before the software is deployed.\nBuilding a software deployment process\nA well thought out software deployment process is important for everything to go without a hitch. Organizations should develop their own processes as they can be based on their unique business requirements or simply on industry best practices, as the case may be. There are three primary phases in the deployment process.\n1. Preparation\nStart things off by collecting the code that needs to be deployed. This is an important part of the process since this ensures that only the correct code is going to be deployed. It's at this stage that the code which needs to be deployed along with configuration files, libraries or resources can be packaged as one resource.\nTo do this, check completed user stories in the project management software or simply the original message that necessitated the start of deployment.\n2. Testing\nNo new software should be deployed unless it has been properly tested. This is done so that no flaws or bugs are found later on.\nThe software first needs to be deployed to a staging environment where all of the required tests can be run through a pre-configured set of tests. Developers then have to review the results and fix any bugs that may have been found.\n3. Deployment\nIt’s only after these crucial stages have been crossed that the software can go live. This is the time when the new code is merged into the production environment.\nThis process is done exactly as it is with the test environment so there should be little to no chance of running into any problems at this stage. As a best practice, check for bugs on the live server just to be safe.\n5 software deployment tools that can kickstart your platform\nThe actual deployment stage can be performed through dedicated tools that aim to streamline the process. These tools try to make the method of distributing the software and any subsequent updates very simple. There's no shortage of deployment tools and most of them support different platforms and infrastructures.\nAWS CodeDeploy\nAmazon has its own software deployment tool called CodeDeploy and its best suited to those who are using Amazon Web Services.\nThe tool can be used to automate deployments to Amazon EC2 instances but that's not all it can do. CodeDeploy can also be used for on-premise software deployments as well.\nWhen the process has been set up, CodeDeploy allows developers to quickly deploy changes, enabling them to take full advantage of the incredible scalability of AWS. Amazon doesn't charge anything for CodeDeploy but payment is required for the AWS cloud computing resources utilized to deploy software.\nBamboo\nBamboo comes from Atlassian, the highly regarded software company behind Jira. The benefit here is that it integrates seamlessly with other Atlassian products. Bamboo offers continuous integration and deployment. It can be used to automate many different tasks like bug detecting and software testing.\nBamboo also allows developers to deploy their apps to app stores automatically, it can be used with any programming language, and it maintains release history archives, making it easier for developers to go back and check something should the need arise. Pricing for Bamboo starts as low as $10.\nJenkins\nJenkins was actually one of the very first automated software deployment tools which is why it continues to be among the most popular. Since it's open source, there's an active community behind it as well with many different plugins available to extend its functionality.\nThis tool allows for the automation of many different tasks like code analysis, bug detection, and software testing. It's capable of working collaboratively with multiple machines as well.\nOctopus Deploy\nThis is an automated release management tool aimed at modern developers and DevOps teams. Octopus Deploy is compatible with many scripting languages like Ruby and bash, it works with Java, ASP.Net, Windows services and more with support for different database types. It's useful for automating deployments in the cloud and on-promises.\nOctopus Deploy is offered for free to some commercial users and small teams. A Pro subscription starts at $700 but can go up exponentially if used as a full-fledged deployment tool that allows support and upgrades as well.\nGitLab CI\nThis continuous integration tool is built into GitLab, a popular Git repo hosting platform that also provides relevant tools. GitLab CI got its start as a standalone project but was later moved into the core and consequently, it can only be used with GitLab now. Like GitLab, this tool is also open source and free for the community version.\nAs you'd expect, it works very well with the GitLab workflow, can be used with GitLab command-line runners, allows you to run your builds on basically anything that supports Go with scripts that work with any programming language.\nWhat about open-source software deployment?\nOpen source software has now become commonplace in the industry, whether that's Linux being used in data centers or Drupal being used to create amazing websites. Even companies like Microsoft and Oracle who were previously strongly opposed to open source software have now evolved to embrace it as its popularity has grown significantly.\nThe challenge with open source software deployment is that these projects are driven by the communities behind them. This means one open source app can have different forms but open source software itself is divided into three primary variants.\nForks have their own development branch and often their own development community. Distributions are a collection of different pieces of software that combine to create the whole product. Vendor distributions are essentially enhanced distributions of open source software sold by vendors like Red Hat, Cloudera, Microsoft and Google.\nThe features of open source software are set by the community. This means new releases don't follow a predictable schedule. Furthermore, these new features might not fulfill the needs of some groups of users.\nIt's also possible that features that developers create may not make it to the main branch of the software simply because the community decided that they're not important.\nOrganizations that deploy open source software in a production environment have to take these differences into account.\nWe can help you deploy your software quickly and effectively\nOne of the most effective ways to go about your software deployment is to work with experts in the field. Working with them ensures that the work is carried out based on industry best practices, thereby saving you time and money as the work is done right the first time.\nZibtek is one of the world’s leading software services providers with offices in Salt Lake, Utah and a global network of highly skilled developers that’s managed from within the United States.\nOur team has worked with both Fortune 500 companies and startups alike, helping them achieve their objectives by streamlining their software deployment processes.\nWe can help create a software deployment process that’s suited to the unique needs of your business.\nIn addition to that, we can work with you to select the best deployment tools that are going to be a great fit for your unique process, and to properly utilize them in order to get the most value.\nOur software deployment services are carried out with the singular goal of achieving the client’s satisfaction.

It involves preparing the software for installation, installing it on the target devices, and then configuring it to meet the needs of the users.\nWhat are some common challenges in software deployment?\nSome common challenges in software deployment include ensuring compatibility with the target system, handling dependencies and conflicts between different software components, and managing configuration changes. Another challenge is ensuring that the deployment process is reliable and repeatable, so that the software can be easily updated or rolled back if necessary.\nWhat are some best practices for software deployment?\nSome best practices for software deployment include automating as much of the process as possible, testing the software thoroughly before deploying it, and having a clear rollback plan in case of any issues. It is also important to communicate with end users and stakeholders during the deployment process to keep them informed of any changes or issues that may arise. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

And they don't understand why their IoT results so often don't match their ambitions.\nIoT or the Internet of Things has taken the form of a buzzword over the past few years, but it’s much more than that. There has been significant advancement in this field in a relatively short amount of time, both from a hardware and a software standpoint.\nThis has allowed for a wide variety of new experiences to be created for use in domestic as well as business environments. The work continues and the Internet of Things is poised to grow even further, becoming more capable of powering new and improved experiences for users.\nWhat is IoT architecture?\nEven though it might seem simple enough, there are actually a lot of moving parts that need to work together in order for the Internet of Things to function as intended. It's vital for all of these different cogs in the machine to work together if the IoT implementation is to function as desired.\nIn the context of the Internet of Things, the architecture is a framework that defines the physical components, the functional organization and configuration of the network, operational procedures and the data formats to be used.\nHowever, there's no single standard reference architecture for IoT as it encompasses a variety of technologies. This means that there's not one easy blueprint that can be followed for all possible implementations.\nIoT architecture can actually vary significantly depending on the implementation; it needs to be open enough with open protocols so that it can support multiple network applications.\nA sustainable Internet of Things ecosystem has four building blocks: functionality, scalability, availability, and maintainability. Scalability is key as the system needs to be able to grow alongside the needs of the organization or project.\nThe three layers of IoT architecture\nEven though there's no single IoT architecture that's universally agreed upon, the most basic and widely accepted format is a three-layer architecture. It was first introduced when the earliest research into the Internet of Things was being carried out. It proposes three layers: Perception, Network, and Application.\nPerception\nThis is the physical layer of the architecture. This is where the sensors and connected devices come into play as they gather various amounts of data as per the need of the project. These can be the edge devices, sensors, and actuators that interact with their environment.\nNetwork\nThe data that's collected by all of these devices needs to be transmitted and processed. That's the network layer's job. It connects these devices to other smart objects, servers, and network devices. It also handles the transmission of all of the data.\nApplication\nThe application layer is what the user interacts with. It's what is responsible for delivering application specific services to the user. This can be a smart home implementation, for example, where users tap a button in the app to turn on a coffee maker.\nThe 4 stages of IoT architecture, explained\nYour infrastructure needs to be able to support the Internet of Things architecture. The four primary stages as defined under are of crucial importance to the overall viability of an IoT implementation.\nConnected Objects\nAn Internet of Things implementation wouldn't exist without the presence of connected or \"smart\" objects. These can be wireless sensors or actuators. They react with the environment and make the data they collect available for analysis.\nActuators take this one step further since they are able to interact with the environment in a significant way. For example, they can be used to shut off valves when the water reaches a certain level or simply to switch off a light when the sun rises.\nInternet Gateway\nOnce the sensors send in the data, it has to be aggregated and converted into digital form so that it can be processed. The second stage of the IoT architecture is what makes this happen. It essentially gets the data ready for processing.\nThe actual task of aggregating and converting the data is up to the data acquisition system. It's what connects to the sensors and actuators, compiles all of their data and then converts it into digital form so that it can be routed over the network by the internet gateway.\nEdge IT Systems\nPre-processing and enhanced analytics of the data is performed in the third stage of an IoT architecture. Edge IT systems are responsible for carrying out these tasks. Since IoT systems collect a significant amount of data and consequently require a lot of bandwidth, these Edge IT systems perform a vital task in reducing the load on the core IT infrastructure.\nMachine learning and visualization technologies are used by Edge IT systems to generate results from the collected data. Insights are provided by machine learning algorithms while the visualization technology presents the data in a way that's easy to understand.\nData Centers and Cloud Storage\nThe data needs to be stored for further in-depth analysis which is why data storage is such an important stage of an IoT architecture. It helps with follow-up revision for feedback as well. Cloud storage is the preferred storage method in IoT implementations.\nThat's also because more in-depth processing which doesn't require immediate feedback can be carried out in the cloud or at physical data centers. There, more capable IT systems can manage, analyze and more securely store the data. This is also where sensor data can be combined with other data sources for more detailed insights.\nUsing IoT architecture in your business software\nYou can supercharge the ROI from your custom business software by implementing an IoT architecture. At its core, such an implementation allows for much more granular data collection. Data is what drives efficiency. The higher the quality of your data, the more valuable insights it can provide.\nFor example, if you use a custom inventory management software for your business, an IoT architecture can help you exercise greater control over this crucial part of the business.\nThis can also help with increased automation as more custom software solutions can be created which can automate the process of reordering materials as they reach a certain threshold or provide insights into consumption trends.\nFor example, there can be a temperature monitoring app for a medicine warehouse. It would use sensors in different parts of the warehouse to detect if temperature and moisture levels are within acceptable range.\nThis will ensure that crucial medical supplies meet all of the quality standards before they're shipped out. IoT-based smart applications can keep an eye on this for you and simply push an alert when something goes wrong.\nAn IoT implementation with a hotel management system would also prove to be highly effective. It can pull in data from sensors that are attached to devices like soap dispensers, coffee machines, vending machines, etc to enable staff to keep an eye on inventory levels in real time.\nThis would eliminate the need for manual checks on these machines multiple times a day, thus leading to a significant increase in the quality of service.\nGet help from the IoT experts\nLet there be no misconception. For all of the benefits that it provides, an Internet of Things implementation is a complex task. There are different protocols that need to be managed, different hardware specifications, and a variety of other technical hurdles that need to be overcome.\nThat’s easier said than done. It’s impossible to have an effective IoT setup up and running unless the work has been done by experts. This will make sure that everything ends up operating smoothly and as it needs to, otherwise, a lot of time would be spent in actually trying to figure out what went wrong where and how it can be fixed.\nEven when you have an IoT architecture established, it’s another complex task to get it integrated with your existing business software. You absolutely don’t need to have new custom software developed. Not only would that mean losing all of the investment made into the earlier iteration, it would also push the implementation timeline.\nIt’s entirely possible to have the architecture integrated with your existing business software, but you’ll need to work with developers who are very familiar with this line of work and have successfully completed similar projects in the past. This isn’t a job that everyone can do.\nThe highly skilled developers at Zibtek have years of experience with the Internet of Things. They have helped countless clients integrate their IoT setups with custom business software to take full advantage of this technology and make their processes more efficient.\nZibtek is one of the leading software development companies in the world which counts both Fortune 500 companies and startups as its customers.

Brand cohesion in turn drives traffic, conversions and revenue.\nAdobe chose Zibtek as its custom software development company to build and integrate Adobe Experience Manager (AEM). Principal engineering spanned a course five-years, covering front end development, backend development and quality assurance and testing. Adobe acquired Livefyre in 2016 and again chose to lean on Zibtek’s custom software development services to integrate the product into the Adobe Experience Manager and Adobe Marketing Cloud.\nCONTACT ZIBTEK TODAY\nOur Strategy\nHow We Work\nCreate\nOur designers work with you to define every feature, screen, and user flow\nSprint\nDaily status updates and receive product builds every two-week's as we add features\nLearn\nWe analyze user feedback to help you prioritize new features\nProblems\nBuilding the initial solution: Adobe required a proof of concept to be developed followed by a minimum viable product.\nApp Components: The platform needed to have the capability to take in and redeploy a wide variety of data sets. Image files, PDFs, gifs, vector files and dozens of inputs needed to be loaded, then redeployed into corresponding locations. These assets had to flawlessly display the corresponding media with other relevant metadata.\nAEM Asset Integration: Integration spanned both Adobe’s internal systems as well as third party connections.\nThe product needed to quickly embrace any upgrades that came down the Adobe Cloud pipeline and accommodate rapid feature development especially when it comes to different versions of AEM.\nSolution\nAfter an initial development phase was completed, we broke into full scrum and began to execute on the LiveFyre team’s vision for a unified branding suite for businesses of all sizes.\nWe built the app components using Mustache and Less.JS, which runs on NodeJS. Additionally, the software used Mocha and Jasmine, which runs on the Karma test runner, to automate test code coverage.\nIntegrations built by Zibtek’s software development services team permitted users to select user-generated content (UGC) from internal libraries and share them with external media sources. Besides using the UGC library, users gained the ability to fetch relevant assets using various filters from social networking sites like Twitter and Instagram. After collecting the assets, users were then able to insert retrieved assets into various app components as required or push them uniformly across all digital channels. To build the AEM Asset Integration UI, we used Coral, Granite, and JavaScript extensively.\nTesting automation was built and automated using Nightwatch JS, a Selenium instance.\nTo facilitate redundancy, we used numerous development kits to build each unique component. As a largely standalone product, the core functionalities specific to the app are handled or managed within a monolithic codebase.\nPrevious\nNext\nResult\nThe Adobe Livefyre project was a major success for the Adobe brand and now serves a major role in the content landscape for brands around the globe. Zibtek’s custom software development services team helped define a new breed of digital experiences by enabling brands to integrate real-time social and unified brand experiences into their content strategy.\n4+\nCountries\n500+\nHappy Clients\n1000+\nProjects\n200+\nDomain Experts\nReady to start your project?\nContact\nText a question\nBy continuing to use this site, you agree to our cookie policy and privacy policy.\nGot it"

The tool helps companies find and prioritize popular and previously submitted ideas from end users on their products and services. By aggregating and weighting client responses, proper merit and direct attention can be more naturally given to the things customers truly care about.\nWith Wantoo, the most valuable ideas for all stakeholders float to the top. Once aggregated, product teams can then sync collected data, gather management input and share reports across communication tools such as Slack, Trello, and Jira.\nThe product’s automatically aggregated and weighted feedback allows companies to capture and prioritize customer needs in a way like never before. The result is better products and engaged customers who participate in product development. Most importantly, companies build up an army of advocates who will extend the company’s reach into their own professional and social networks.\nCONTACT ZIBTEK TODAY\nOur Strategy\nHow We Work\nCreate\nOur designers and architects work with you to define every feature, screen, and user flow.\nSprint\nReceive product builds every two-week's as we add features.\nLearn\nWe analyze user feedback to help you prioritize new features.\nProblems\nThe client identified a gap in the market for product teams that wanted to automatically aggregate customer feedback. The non-technical founder needed a custom software development firm to bring their idea to life.\nThe goal was to create a minimum viable product that could be salable at launch and also be used on itself. The business model chosen was SaaS software development; the client wanted an immediately marketable product.\nInitial market feedback suggested that building a SaaS product was a natural fit because the product had to be adaptable to varying team and customer base sizes and still analyze the feedback given by clients or team members in a dynamic and familiar way for small teams.\nThe tool, as it was conceived, had a built-in feedback loop – when firms used it, data drove the product development roadmap.\nThe platform required direct API integration with Jira, Slack and customer relationship management systems like SalesForce and a wide range of third-party platforms.\nSolution\nWe guided the company through a preliminary discovery phase that included wireframing, design and architecture.\nAs a result of preliminary planning, determinations were made to scale back components of the initial scope to focus on the core aspects of what the business truly needed to launch.\nWe helped Wantoo design and develop the novel concept of ‘Idea Boards’ that help firms get feedback whenever customers interact with a product and company.\nEvery physical data point in the customer journey, digital, or mobile became collectable with just a single line of code.\nIntegrated with Zendesk, Salesforce, Twitter, and Facebook APIs among other social platforms, the tool could be implemented by enterprise firms from day one.\nPrevious\nNext\n4+\nCountries\n500+\nHappy Clients\n1000+\nProjects\n200+\nDomain Experts\nReady to start your project?\nContact\nText a question\nBy continuing to use this site, you agree to our cookie policy and privacy policy.\nGot it"

Scalability, speed and other performance problems began to suffer as the system gained greater adoption. Statix needed a custom software development to take the original vision and functionality of the core application built in WordPress and convert it to a scalable application that could handle significantly more usage volume.\nAs the software houses sensitive patient data, the client needed healthcare and software development services, largely focused on HIPAA compliance. The client wanted to allow the solution to be scalable and accommodate the growth of the business. Additional functionality was also added to further enhance security, compliance and the delivery of patient data. They also wanted to enhance the functionalities of the custom web application to streamline their business processes, delivering high-className performance to their customers.\nProblems with the application:\nIn application, around 40% of the functionalities were done manually by the client, including:\nManually updated attempt logs: Site coordinators (people who manage the surveys being conducted) had to manually update records in the database about the attempted calls made to study participants. For instance, if site coordinators or interviewers call a patient to take feedback or ask certain questions for surveys, and the patient didn’t answer the call or his/her phone number was incorrect, then the site coordinators had to enter these records (‘call not answered’ or ‘wrong number’) manually in the database.\nManually scheduled surveys for patients: Site coordinators had to manually schedule or prioritize the surveys (consisting of a set of questions) for their patients for a certain date or time.\nNo proper randomization for clinical trials: There was no proper randomization process on the website. Site coordinators wanted a reliable method to eliminate all the sources of bias in the treatment assignments, ensuring equality among the patients in terms of receiving treatments and data recorded.\nThe backend functionalities of the web application were written in PHP and largely outdated. To compound the problem, the website used WordPress as its Content Management System (CMS), which caused various issues for the client such as improper data handling, problems with refreshing pages, data storage issues, etc.\nIn order to enhance and improve their web application, they wanted to migrate from the old technologies-- PHP and WordPress to some of the latest technologies available.In order to enhance and improve their web application, they wanted to migrate from the old technologies-- PHP and WordPress to some of the latest technologies available.\nThe website did not have a proper authentication process. The client needed to keep their network secure by only permitting verified users to access protected resources.\nThe client needed a Business Intelligence (BI) tool on the website in order to see the business progress and survey responses of the patients in the form of charts. They also needed a BI tool that was within their budget.\nSolution\nThis project was resolved by domain-specific experts and engineers. Our specialists were able to deliver high-quality service that exactly met the unique business needs to build the custom healthcare application.\nThe solutions we provided to address the problems:\nWe automated all the work that was previously done manually in the application. Some primary issues resolved included:\nAutomated updating of attempt logs in the database using Angular:Using Bootstrap and Angular, we automated the task of updating attempt logs in the database. We created a list, ‘Attempt type’ on the website that contained various options (including ‘No answer’, ‘Email sent’, ‘Phone busy’, and more). Unlike before, site coordinators no longer need to enter the patient's ‘attempt logs’ record manually in the database. Users simply needed to pick any option from the ‘attempt type’ list, and the record will automatically get updated in the database.\nAutomated scheduling of surveys using Angular:Using Angular, we automated the scheduling of surveys on the website. We provided a list of options, from which the site coordinators or interviewers from the client side can select any date or time they want to take surveys. The surveys will automatically trigger on the web application at the selected time and date.\nProvided a proper randomization process using MEAN stack (Full-stack JavaScript, including MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, and Node.js): Using MEAN stack, we provided a proper randomization process (the most reliable method for clinical trials) available on web application. The structure doesn’t allow hospitals or doctors to manipulate the results; removes bias, providing a real representation to the patients regarding the treatment or drugs used.\nUsing MEAN stack, we improved and enhanced all the backend functionalities of the software application that were outdated. We reduced load time for all web pages and resolved all the issues related to data storage and data handling. Also, we modernized the interfaces for the entire front-end leveraging modularized loading capabilities.\nUsing the Twilio REST API, our developers coded the app to provide a two-factor authentication (2FA) process and resolve security concerns.\nWe embedded a Business Intelligence (BI) tool--MongoDB Charts. This reporting tool represents data in the form of dynamically created charts. With MongoDB Charts, the client was able to derive key insights, such as how a given study is progressing, how the users are responding to the application, and how the survey responses from patients were progressing, etc.\nAfter significant research, our experts presented Microsoft Power BI and MongoDB Charts as a budget-friendly option.\nDevelopers used a cloud service-- MongoDB Atlas\nNode.js APIs were connected to MongoDB Atlas from the application\nThey also added additional security features, including:\nAdmins, super admin on the client, were created and authorized to access the database or dashboard of the website in order to create charts programmatically.\nAdmin and super admins on the client site can grant access to the database and grant view permissions to end users..\nPrevious\nNext\nResult\nReliance on the heavily modified wordpress CMS was ended with the launch of the new, custom software application. Following the successful web application launch, the client has begun further development of a mobile application project in order to further enhance the product offering.\nBusiness outcomes that we delivered for this project:\nApplication data retrieval and loading times were reduced by 90%, improving the overall application performance.\nThe application became scalable with increased hardware availability.\n40% increased in automation, as manual work has been eliminated.\nWith the introduction of new technology and services, we delivered an error-free and superior quality application to our client using a cost-effective approach.\nUsing modern technologies, our developers added additional functionality above the previous web application, enabling it to meet the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) policy standards.\n4+\nCountries\n500+\nHappy Clients\n1000+\nProjects\n200+\nDomain Experts\nReady to start your project?\nContact\nText a question\nBy continuing to use this site, you agree to our cookie policy and privacy policy.\nGot it"

When a patient is receiving expensive cosmetic or dental work it is a real possibility that life events or accidents after the fact could lead to expensive rework. Patients at dental practices who use Dental Warranty gain the ability to ensure their investment is protected. Dental practices benefit from incremental revenue and patients save money; both parties reduce risk.\nWhen a dental patient receives cosmetic, restorative, fixed or removable dental treatment, many of these dental treatments are not covered under a patient’s insurance policy. In some cases it could be prohibitively expensive for a patient to pay the huge dental bills for any rework.\nAs a result of using the service, treatments are backed by a world-className warranty policy and transferable to other dentists using the service. The outcome is peace-of-mind and savings for dentists as well as patients.\nCONTACT ZIBTEK TODAY\nOur Strategy\nHow We Work\nCreate\nOur designers and architects work with you to define every feature, screen, and user flow\nSprint\nReceive product builds every two-week's as we add features\nLearn\nReceive product builds every two-week's as we add features\nProblems\nOver the years, the application architecture had been modified several times and included older versions of available technologies.

To maintain productivity and growth for the firm, the company needed to evaluate structural issues with the codebase.\nThe application was also lagging behind in needed updates and enhancements which would materially facilitate long term objectives in the business model. It needed improvements in front-end and back-end functionalities.\nThe client was facing issues maintaining the database for their customers’ warranty and insurance accounts. And, in some instances page loading time on the web application was significant, leading to slow performance.\nA robust account set up was needed on the web application in order to display the proper information to the customers who signed up for the product.\nFinally, as numerous practices were using the software, ongoing support requests had to be accomplished in addition to other tasks. The application was not properly optimized to resolve routine support issues and unique customer concerns often required direct database level updates.\nSolution\nAs the system used an older version of Angular, our team had to focus on cleaning up components which could be resolved with a degree of finality. Angular components which could be updated were improved and enhanced ensuring data was being properly saved in the back-end. Numerous functions were re-written along with enhancements to the user interface for the web application. Particular issues resolved in the Angular front end include:\nCreated uniform dialogue popups – we made a dynamic className structure to ensure that the correct pop-ups messages were getting properly displayed for every customer (dental office) who accessed the website to register coverage for their patients.\nEliminate data redundancy issues – in our audit, our developers discovered that the app was coded in a way that made use of numerous redundant classNamees. Significant measures were taken to eliminate problematic, redundant data issues between the .Net and Angular application layers.\nSpeed and performance optimization - we were able to improve web application performance and optimize numerous queries for speed. Proper segregation of data reduced page loading time and improved available bandwidth on the server, making the app run significantly faster for end users.\nUsing proper REST API structures, we fixed the following back-end issues on the web application:\nWe corrected the pending registration list to properly display data, whereas before, even if the number of registrations exceeds the previous maximum, it would display.\nAccount set up issues were resolved to allow the display of the relevant information, including a list of warranties, coverage, and insurance, when customers or users signed up on the product.\nPrevious\nNext\nResult\nThrough dedication to the project, we delivered the following business outcomes:\nTask turnaround time improved by 70% over previously observed periods. Refactored API code storage and the entire deployment processes, reduced deployments from several hours to under an hour.\nA robust database alert system was added to notify internal teams and management to server issues.\nStability was materially enhanced for the company and end users.\nAfter the application was properly optimized, the client was able to deliver enhanced value to their customers and return their focus to new features.\n4+\nCountries\n500+\nHappy Clients\n1000+\nProjects\n200+\nDomain Experts\nReady to start your project?\nContact\nText a question\nBy continuing to use this site, you agree to our cookie policy and privacy policy.\nGot it"

With increased user volume, the firm also needed staff augmentation services to support growing support and QA needs. The firm wanted to update all four web application views, Fortify, Turn, Lift and RecoverySuite. With business growth, their solutions were becoming more complex and the growing codebase required more hands to maintain. They also needed legacy code to be refactored and made into a scalable solution that would serve the growing business needs of their clients.\nProblems faced by the client:\nThe custom web application required material refactoring of core components. Numerous legacy code conflicts were causing the hardware to peg the server resulting in frequent database freezes.\nApart from improvements to server side rendering performance, the application required numerous updates and additions to existing functionality to meet their unique business needs. Enterprise clients wanted enhancements to core survey sections and to implement new features and functionality to enable broader reach to a wide variety of audiences.\nAverage page loading time within the web application was 40 seconds on an ideal network connection. Materially reducing load time, softened jarring for the user, meant that the delivery of data to the front end had to be updated asynchronously. The obvious result of better load time would be delivery of a better user experience to their customers.\nSolution\nOur team executed a comprehensive code audit in parallel with the current development team. The objective was twofold – we wanted to evaluate the defects within the system and the inefficiencies in the software development process. The desired outcome was to materially enhance the performance of Fortify, Turn, Lift and Recovery Suite, improve the consumer experience and allow the application to truly scale. Of note, the interest of enterprise clients also required additional security and testing measures to be put in place to enhance data integrity.\nCritical paths executed for improvement and enhancement of the applications:\nOperating within the existing Ruby on Rails and SQL environments, our developers worked to eradicate all issues causing hardware lockups and database freezing. This resolved immediate issues.\nNew features and functionalities were added in the survey section of the web app. These enhancements and modifications simplified the process of conducting online surveys while increasing the user interactivity in the application, increasing on-page engagement.\nSolutions had to be provided without disrupting active users in any material way. Our developers navigated these issues by deploying at low system utilization times and in the evenings. Front-end enhancements led to the improvement of APIs as they often presented low hanging fruit opportunities for code repair.\nPrevious\nNext\nResult\nZibtek’s custom software development services team was able to deliver material enhancements to the client in relatively short order. Improvements applied to all four web applications: Fortify, Turn, Lift and Recovery Suite and extended to their mobile applications as well. Operating to resolve critical path items resulted in the following business outcomes:\nAverage page loading times reduced from 40 seconds to 3 seconds.\nStreamlined and enhanced database functionality improving service effectiveness and reducing downtime.\nAn almost 80% reduction in effort required to troubleshoot bugs from taking real-time feedback and conducting surveys, improving the overall business value.\nCustomer satisfaction is enhanced by 50%.\nIncreased application use, growing to over 155 countries\nFollowing the client’s complete satisfaction with our work, they outsourced the creation of a mobile application to us in order to develop a new mobile application from scratch.\n4+\nCountries\n500+\nHappy Clients\n1000+\nProjects\n200+\nDomain Experts\nReady to start your project?\nContact\nText a question\nBy continuing to use this site, you agree to our cookie policy and privacy policy.\nGot it"

This has led to big changes in the way software products are designed and deployed. In this context, co-development is the term used to describe the creative process in which different parties or teams or firms come together to develop superior software products. But why should you consider it for your business? What difference does it make? What are the benefits and challenges of co-development of software? What is Co-Development Software?\nAs we mentioned earlier, co-development software is the process of increasing collaboration among stakeholders like data scientists, designers, project managers, developers in the making of software products. It encourages teamwork, letting more than one group work efficiently. It enhances communication and decision making, and builds trust among team members.\nCo-developing software is like building a house with a team of skilled professionals—architects, engineers, carpenters, and electricians. Each person brings their unique expertise to the project, working together to create a cohesive structure.\nJust as the team uses shared blueprints, schedules, and tools to manage dependencies and track progress, software teams use centralized platforms, version control systems, and project management tools to ensure smooth collaboration. For instance, pull requests in software development are like regular site inspections in construction, ensuring quality and alignment with the overall plan.\nIntegrating diverse technologies lead to impactful solutions that are used to enhance user experience and when combined with domain knowledge that helps with innovation and development cycles.

A Glimpse into Daily Web Creation\nThere is no doubt that web developers are highly in demand as more and more companies are opting to move their businesses online. But what does a typical day look like for a web developer? Let’s take a deep dive. A web developer is someone who is responsible for programming code that instructs websites and web applications on how to operate. Web developers specialize in front-side/client-side development or back-end/server-side development. There are versatile and highly-sought after professionals who can do both and they are known as full-stack developers. Web developers implement visual designs, layouts, integrated graphics and content, optimizes website performance and capacity, testing to make sure that the website performs well across any computers, mobile devices, and screens.\nThe main job of web developers is to write code in some most widely used web programming languages namely JavaScript, HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), React, Node.js, .NET and more.\nA web developer also spends a lot of time in collaboration and communication with others on larger development teams that include software developers, web designers, project managers, and other stakeholders. A web developer can work solo or as part of a team consisting of junior web developers, UX/UI designer, project managers, etc., based on the nature of their organization as a freelancer or a full-time developer. With the help of web developers, businesses can increase their online presence and client base while connecting with potential customers through their own web applications. Typical Day of a Web Developer\nWeb Developer's Day in Life\nWhile the daily routine of every web developer will be different based on the employer, specialization, and current projects, few of the core tasks will be taking up most of their time.\nIt goes without saying that writing codes constitutes a bulk of any developers’ work day. Here is a brief list on some of the major coding tasks they have to take up:\nTranslation of wireframes or mockup design into working interfaces- a developer writes the codes for visual layouts by using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and any other language while working on their own design or the one created by a UX/UI designer. Enabling site functionality by writing backend code- when it comes to dynamic websites and web apps, backend code takes care of everything- user authentication and databases to API integrations and server configuration. Some of common languages used are PHP, Python, Java and C#/NET. Site speed and performance optimization- ensuring that websites are fast and seamless by shortening file sizes, using caching, compressing images, cleaning unnecessary codes, etc. Additionally, when new features or functionalities are added to the website, coding responsibilities by fixing bugs and maintaining digital products continue to add up to their daily task list.

And by “developer experience”, we mean the convenience of the developer as they tend to choose frameworks that are easy to use. But one of the major decisions that any developer has to take before the beginning of the development lifecycle is to consider which platform will be used.\nThis is also where many developers struggle with the question of Next JS vs React. So, in this blog, we will provide an understanding so it helps you choose the right technology stack for the right project.\nPhoto by Chris Ried on Unsplash\nUnderstanding Next.js and React: Key Concepts Explained\nWhat is Next JS?\nA creation of Vercel, Next.js is an open-source JavaScript framework. It allows developers to create quick and user-friendly web applications as well as static websites by using React. Based on Node.js and Babel, Next JS allows developers to integrate itself with React to develop. This helps make server-side convenient and easy.\nIt is an open-source and lightweight web development framework for React applications.\nWith the help of Next JS, developers can build server-side rendering. Next.js is based on React babel and webpack that provides out of the box solutions for server-side rendering (SSR) or React components. Features of Next.js include:\nStatic Site Generation (SSG): Pre-building pages into static HTML files for speeding up loading time and lessen server load. Static Site Rendering (SSR): Provides in-built support to developers for server-side rendering that allows pages to be pre-rendered on the server. This also leads to better website and SEO performance.\nDynamic rendering: Rendering pages on the server when requested t content that is up-to-date.\nPartial pre-rendering: Combining static and dynamic rendering on the same page.\nAutomatic code splitting: Splits code automatically into smaller bundles for quicker loading time of pages.\nBuilt-in CSS and Sass support: Allows developers to import styles directly into components.\nAPI routes: Simplifies backend integration by allowing developers to create serverless functions directly in the application.\nQuick refresh: Provides instant feedback during the process of development.\nIntegration with popular tools: for maintaining code quality and using static typing, it allows itself to get integrated with tools like ESLint and TypeScript.\nServerless deployment support: Developers can efficiently deploy applications to any cloud environment without setting up and maintaining a server.\nFile-based routing: Allows developers to map out URLs directly to files in the project’s directory.\nMeta tags: Developers can characterize every page with independent titles, keywords, and portrayals.\nData Fetching: Offers different fetching methods like getStaticProps and getServerSideProps, for fetching data at build time or request time.\nImage Optimization: In Next.js, images are automatically optimized which in return optimizes loading time by resizing and compressing images.\nAPI proxying: Create API routes that can work as third-party APIs by aiding fetching of data and security.\nInternationalization Support: Provides tools and libraries for adding multi-lingual support to an application. Photo by Rahul Mishra on Unsplash\nWhat is React?\nDeveloped by Facebook, React is an open-source and flexible JavaScript library that allows developers to come up with scalable, simple, and fast frontend interfaces for both single-page and multipage web applications. It has a reactive approach and supports a functional programming paradigm. One of the most extensively used front-end libraries that allow developers to create reusable UI components, React is an easy-to-use-front-end library offering different tools that enclose routing and state management patterns beside Redux and other libraries.\nThe user interface of React is a combination of HTML and JavaScript that contains all the logic that is needed for displaying a small piece of a bigger scale of UI (user interface). In order to keep users on your web page, it is imperative that the user interface is at its best. Features of React include:\nJSX (JavaScript Syntax Extension): A combination of HTML and JavaScript, developers can embed JavaScript objects inside the HTML elements. Since JSX is not supported by browsers, Babel compiler transcompiles the code into JavaScript. With the help of JSX, codes become easy and understandable, especially if anyone has prior knowledge of HTML and JavaScript.\nVirtual DOM: DOM or Document Object Model is one of the most significant parts of the web since it divides modules and executes the code. While JavaScript updates the whole DOM at one go, React uses virtual DOM, an exact copy of the real DOM. So, whenever the web application is modified, the whole virtual DOM gets updated first and then finds the difference between real and virtual DOM. One-way Data Binding: As the name suggests, the data flow in React is in one direction- from the top to the bottom. When the transfer from the parent component to the child component happens, the props in the child component cannot flow back to the parent component. However, it is possible to communicate with the parent components for modifying the states as per the given inputs. Performance: Since React uses virtual DOM and updates just the modified parts, it makes the DOM run faster. Extension: By using different extensions of React, we can also create complete UI applications that support mobile app development and also provide server-side rendering. Extensions such as Flux, Redux, React Native, etc. also help in building good-looking UI. Conditional Statements: JSX lets developers write conditional statements. Simplicity: React is component-based, and this makes the code reusable and easy to understand. It is also easy to debug and developers have to sweat less on coding. Photo by Fotis Fotopoulos on Unsplash\nNext js vs React: Core Differences\nIn the debate of react vs next js, let’s take a quick look at the differences: NEXT JS REACT\nNext js is a framework for react that is built on react library. React is not a framework, it is a JavaScript library.\nIt is famous for server-side rendering and generation of static websites. Doesn’t support server-side rendering.\nCan be difficult to learn for anyone who does not have knowledge of React. Easier to learn.\nWeb apps can be built very quickly. Building web applications is slower.\nDoes not need offline support. Needs offline support.\nDoes not require index.html file as it is made as per the kind of need One HTML file index.html is present in the public folder that manages the app.\nIf you choose Next JS, it comes with the best server-side rendering along with static website development solutions. It also lets you manage project\nNext JS vs React: Which is right for your project?\nThere is no right answer for the question of react vs next js as the choice depends on the need of the project. Both of them are emerging and beneficial tools for your project. But they are only functional for performing some tasks. s easily with various tools and features.\nReact, on the other hand, is the ideal choice for developing user interfaces for single-page applications. As it works with the layer of mobile and web apps, it lets you create more appealing and intuitive applications. In the debate between next.js and react, there is no one winner. However, we hope that with this article, we have given you some insight to choose right. What is the main difference between Next.js and React?\nNext.js is a framework that adds server-side rendering and static site generation to React. React is a JavaScript library primarily for building user interfaces.\nIs Next.js better than React for SEO?\nYes, Next.js has built-in server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), making it better for SEO than React, which only supports client-side rendering by default.\nCan I use React components in Next.js?\nAbsolutely! Next.js is built on top of React, so any React component can be used within a Next.js application.\nIs Next.js harder to learn than React?\nIf you're already familiar with React, learning Next.js should be straightforward. Next.js adds some additional concepts but simplifies tasks like routing and server-side rendering.\nWhat types of projects are best suited for React vs. Next.js?\nReact is ideal for dynamic, single-page applications, while Next.js is better suited for projects that benefit from fast-loading pages and SEO optimization, like blogs, e-commerce sites, and portfolios.

    "extractedText": "Why Publications Should Cite Authoritative Sources and Use Do-Follow Links\nLearn how citing authoritative sources and using do-follow links can boost credibility and improve SEO rankings. Discover key benefits backed by research.\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n11 OCT 2024 • 2 MIN READ\nPhoto by Merakist / Unsplash\nIntroduction:\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of SEO, citing authoritative sources has become a powerful way for websites to boost their credibility, improve search rankings, and offer more value to their readers. With so much content being generated by AI publications, we should take note of the significant benefits that come with linking to high-quality external sources using do-follow links.\n1. Credibility and Trust\nWhen a publication links out to authoritative sources, it signals to both readers and search engines that the content is well-researched and trustworthy. By citing credible sources, publications show that they are contributing to a broader, fact-checked discussion, which enhances their own reputation.\n2. SEO Benefits: Ahrefs Study\nSam Oh from Ahrefs highlights in a YouTube video (at the 7:35 mark) that websites that link out to high Domain Rating (DR) external resources rank higher than those that don’t. According to Ahrefs’ findings, pages that use do-follow links to authoritative sources consistently perform better in search rankings. This demonstrates how giving credit through proper external links can contribute to better SEO results.\n3. Zibtek’s Own Research\nAt Zibtek, we conducted our own experiment by publishing three blog posts over a 10-day period. In our findings, blog posts that linked to external authoritative sources ranked 3x faster and achieved 2x the number of top 10 keywords compared to those that didn’t. This shows how quickly and effectively citations can help increase organic search visibility.\n4. Better User Experience and Engagement\nCiting external resources with do-follow links doesn’t just benefit SEO; it also enhances the user experience. When readers encounter credible, properly linked resources, they are more likely to stay engaged, trust the content, and explore more related topics. This leads to higher engagement metrics like longer session durations and lower bounce rates—both of which are important factors for SEO.\n5. Ethical Considerations: Giving Credit Where It’s Due\nBeyond SEO and user experience, giving proper credit to original sources through do-follow links is an ethical practice. Larger publications benefit from content produced by authoritative sources, and it's only fair to acknowledge and support those sources by passing on SEO equity in the form of do-follow links.\nConclusion:\nFor larger publications, linking out to authoritative sources with do-follow links is a win-win strategy. It not only boosts search rankings and SEO performance but also provides a better user experience and helps build a network of trust and credibility. Whether through data, expert opinion, or external research, citing authoritative sources is a powerful way to strengthen the impact of your content. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

Unlike a prototype, which demonstrates the look and feel of the software, a POC focuses on validating specific aspects of the concept, such as technical capabilities, performance, and potential challenges.\n💡 According to a survey by TechRepublic, 53% of software projects use a POC to validate ideas before full-scale development, reducing the risk of project failure.\nThe Benefits of Creating a PoC in Software Development\nRisk Mitigation: One of the most significant benefits of a PoC is its ability to identify potential challenges and technical issues early in the development process. By addressing these risks upfront, teams can avoid costly mistakes and reduce the likelihood of project failure. For example, a PoC can uncover integration challenges with third-party systems, allowing the team to adjust their approach before investing significant resources.\nCost Efficiency: Developing a full-scale product without validating the concept can be expensive. A PoC allows you to test the viability of an idea with minimal investment, ensuring that resources are only allocated to projects that have a high likelihood of success. This approach can save both time and money by preventing the development of features or solutions that may not work as expected.\nStakeholder Buy-In: A successful PoC can serve as a powerful tool for securing stakeholder support. By demonstrating that a concept works in practice, you can build confidence among investors, clients, and team members. This can be particularly valuable when trying to secure funding, gain approval for a project, or align team members around a common goal.\nFaster Time-to-Market: By validating the feasibility of an idea early on, a PoC can streamline the development process and accelerate time-to-market. Once a PoC is proven successful, teams can move forward with greater confidence, avoiding the delays that often come with unexpected technical challenges or redesigns. This can be a competitive advantage in fast-paced industries where being first to market is crucial.\nEnhanced Collaboration: A PoC encourages collaboration between different stakeholders, including developers, designers, business analysts, and clients. By working together to validate the concept, teams can ensure that everyone is aligned on the project’s goals and requirements. This collaborative approach can lead to better communication, fewer misunderstandings, and a more cohesive final product.\nClear Path Forward: A PoC provides a clear and practical roadmap for the next steps in the development process towards digital transformation. It allows teams to refine their approach, make necessary adjustments, and proceed with full-scale development with a solid understanding of what needs to be done. This clarity can improve project planning and increase the chances of a successful outcome. At Zibtek, we have found our time estimates are 35% more accurate if we have done the PoC work on the most complex parts of the project upfront.\nExamples of a POC in Software Development\nIntegrating a New Payment Gateway: A retail company wants to integrate a new third-party payment gateway into its existing e-commerce platform. Before fully developing and deploying this feature, the development team creates a POC. This POC involves building a simple interface that processes a few test transactions using the new payment gateway. The purpose is to ensure the integration is technically feasible, works smoothly with the company’s existing systems, and maintains security standards. If the POC succeeds, it will give the green light for the full development of the feature, knowing that the technical approach is sound.\nImplementing a Machine Learning Algorithm: A healthcare startup is exploring machine learning to predict patient outcomes based on historical data. The team decides to create a POC to test the concept. They develop a basic model using a limited dataset to see if the algorithm can accurately predict outcomes in a small, controlled scenario. The POC might involve training the algorithm on past patient data and testing its predictions on a new set of cases. If the model shows promise, the company can confidently develop a full-scale machine-learning solution, knowing the core idea is feasible.\nCloud Migration of a Legacy System: A financial services company is considering migrating its legacy on-premise system to a cloud-based platform. Before the entire migration, the IT team creates a POC to test the process. This involves migrating a small, non-critical system component to the cloud to evaluate performance, security, and compatibility. The POC helps identify potential issues and provides insights into the tools and methods needed for a smooth transition. If the POC is successful, it lays the groundwork for the entire migration, reducing the risks of moving a critical system to the cloud.\nEvaluate New Team Members: A POC is also a way to learn about someone's skills and abilities and give you an idea of how they perform and integrate with your team. You can learn much more about someone with a POC than in an interview. This can be used with a potential firm or contractor to see how well you work together.\nIn each of these examples, the POC is a crucial early step in the development process, helping validate the concept, mitigate risks, and ensure a clear path forward for the project. These are just a few examples. If you are unclear on how a POC might work for you, we would be happy to have a strategy call and brainstorm some options.\nCrucial Factors for a Successful PoC in Software Development\nCreating a Proof of Concept (PoC) in software development is a powerful way to validate ideas and ensure that a project is feasible before fully committing resources. However, the success of a PoC hinges on several crucial factors that must be carefully considered and executed. Here are the key factors that contribute to a successful PoC:\nClear Objectives and Scope: Before embarking with a PoC, it’s essential to define clear objectives. What specific problem are you trying to solve? What technical or business goals must be achieved? Clearly outlining the scope helps ensure that the PoC remains focused and relevant, preventing scope creep and ensuring that the evaluation is manageable within the given timeframe. It's easy to push a PoC too hard, essentially turning it into full-blown development and eliminating the benefits of the spike exercise.\nStakeholder Alignment: Ensure that all relevant stakeholders are aligned on the PoC’s goals, expectations, and success criteria. This includes developers, project managers, business leaders, and clients. Regular communication and collaboration throughout the PoC process help keep everyone on the same page and increase the likelihood of gaining buy-in for the next stages of development.\nDefined Success Criteria: Establishing measurable success criteria is crucial for determining whether the PoC has achieved its objectives. These criteria might include performance benchmarks, user acceptance metrics, or technical feasibility assessments. By having clear metrics in place, teams can objectively evaluate the PoC’s success and make informed decisions about moving forward.\nAppropriate Resource Allocation: A successful PoC requires the right mix of resources, including skilled developers, appropriate tools, and sufficient time. Under-resourcing the PoC can lead to incomplete or unreliable results, while over-resourcing may cause unnecessary delays and costs. Carefully balance resources to ensure that the PoC is both efficient and thorough.\nRealistic and Relevant Testing Scenarios: The scenarios used to test the PoC should closely mimic the real-world conditions in which the final product will operate. This includes using realistic datasets, simulating typical user interactions, and considering environmental factors that might impact performance. By testing the PoC in relevant conditions, you can gain more accurate insights into its viability.\nIterative Feedback and Improvement: A PoC should be an iterative process with continuous feedback and refinement. As the PoC progresses, gather input from stakeholders, users, and technical teams to identify any issues or areas for improvement. Use this feedback to make adjustments and optimize the PoC, ensuring it evolves in response to real-world challenges.\nRisk Management: Identify potential risks early in the PoC process and develop mitigation strategies. This might involve technical risks, such as compatibility issues, or business risks, such as budget overruns. Proactively managing risks helps ensure that the PoC stays on track and that any issues are addressed before they escalate.\nDocumentation and Analysis: Thorough documentation of the PoC process, findings, and outcomes is essential for making informed decisions about the next steps. Detailed records allow stakeholders to understand the rationale behind decisions, the challenges encountered, and the lessons learned. This documentation is invaluable for guiding full-scale development if the PoC is successful.\nDon't go too far: Do not create a large scope for a POC. Sometimes, stakeholders want to eliminate every possible risk and end up investing so much time in the POC that it basically becomes a development project. The point is to spend as little as possible to evaluate 80% of the issues. Don't overdo it.\nFAQs for POC's in Software Development\nHow does a POC differ from a prototype?\nA POC focuses on testing the viability of a specific concept or technology, often involving limited functionality or features. A prototype, on the other hand, is a working model that demonstrates the look, feel, and basic functionality of the final product. While a POC answers the question, \"Can this be done?\", a prototype shows \"How will this look and work?\".\nWhen should a POC be created in the software development life cycle?\nA POC is typically created during the early stages of the software development life cycle, often during the conceptualization or design phase. It’s used to test the feasibility of critical aspects of the project before moving on to more detailed design and development stages.\nHow long does it take to develop a POC?\nThe time required to develop a POC varies depending on the complexity of the concept being tested. Generally, a POC can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks to complete. The goal is to keep the POC focused and efficient, testing only the most critical elements necessary to validate the concept.\nWhat are some common scenarios where a POC is used?\nPOCs are commonly used when introducing new technologies, integrating third-party systems, validating new business models, or testing innovative features. For example, a company might develop a POC to test the integration of a new payment gateway into their existing system or to explore the feasibility of using machine learning for predictive analytics.\nHow is the success of a POC measured?\nThe success of a POC is measured based on predefined success criteria, which could include technical feasibility, performance metrics, user acceptance, and scalability. These criteria are established before the POC begins and are used to determine whether the concept should proceed to full-scale development.\nWhat are the risks associated with skipping the POC stage?\nSkipping the POC stage can lead to several risks, including project failure due to unforeseen technical challenges, wasted resources on unviable solutions, and a lack of stakeholder confidence. Without a POC, there’s a higher likelihood of encountering significant issues during full-scale development, which could lead to delays, cost overruns, and unmet expectations.\nCan a POC be used to secure funding or stakeholder approval?\nYes, a successful POC can be a powerful tool for securing funding or gaining stakeholder approval. By demonstrating that the concept works in practice, a POC provides tangible evidence that the project is worth pursuing, which can be crucial for obtaining the necessary support and resources.\nWhat happens after a successful POC?\nAfter a successful POC, the project typically moves into the next stages of development, such as detailed design, prototyping, and full-scale development. The insights gained from the POC are used to refine the project plan, address any identified challenges, and ensure that the final product meets the desired objectives.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, prototype development is an essential practice in software engineering that combines creativity, technical expertise, and user feedback to bring ideas to life. Whether validating a concept with a POC or speeding up the development process with rapid prototyping, these techniques are invaluable for building successful software solutions.\nAt Zibtek, we really like to start with a small POC together in order to understand how we can help and if our skills meet your expectations.

    "extractedText": "Outstaffing vs. Outsourcing: Balancing Flexibility & Cost\nExamine the tug of war between flexibility and cost in outstaffing vs. outsourcing. Which approach offers the best balance for your business in 2024?\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n13 AUG 2024 • 5 MIN READ\nZibtek Outstaffing Team\nOutstaffing and Outsourcing are all the same, right? Well, not exactly; there are some critical differences. Most people don't even realize that outstaffing is really an option. With outstaffing, you get to choose an overseas employee, train them, and get the cost-benefit of a long-term arrangement, but you also have the benefits of them working in an office with local management, HR, and reliable internet and power. So, there are still a lot of benefits outside of hiring a freelancer as well.\nWith outsourcing, you can rent a resource for a day, week, or month with zero commitment, so the firm has to raise rates and cover for the non-billable time across all of the projects that year. Think of it like the difference between using an Airbnb and owning a second home for your vacations. They both allow you to vacation, but they provide different experiences. Let's get into the details, and you can evaluate which strategy to take advantage of.\nWhat is Outstaffing?\nOutstaffing is a model where businesses hire remote employees to work as an extension of their in-house team. These remote workers are employed by a third-party vendor but are managed directly by the client. This approach offers flexibility in scaling the workforce while maintaining control over the project's direction.\nAt Zibtek, we call this model Workforce+. We allow customers to use our Bangalore operations center and HR team to hire whoever they want among the 1.1 billion people in India. We take care of the office, computer, payroll compliance, HR, federal taxes, etc. The client is responsible for that employee's output and makes the final hiring decision, as well as yearly appraisals and compensation increases. Under this model, the customer does not pay for the increased pricing that outsourcing companies add in order to manage downtime for staff that is not billable. We have seen an average of 40% cost savings in this model, and candidates typically have more experience as well.\nWhat is Outsourcing?\nOutsourcing involves hiring a third-party company to handle entire projects or specific business functions. The outsourced team works independently, taking responsibility for delivering results. Outsourcing is charged hourly or by milestone. This model is typically chosen for its cost-effectiveness and ability to leverage external expertise. The customer does not hold a commitment to the employee or the non-billable time. It is known for its tremendous flexibility.\nPros and Cons of Outstaffing\nPros:\nIncreased Control: Companies maintain direct oversight of remote employees, ensuring that project goals align with business objectives.\nScalability: Easily scale your team up or down based on project needs without personally expanding your office space.\nAccess to Global Talent: Tap into a diverse talent pool, allowing you to find specialists with the exact skills required for your project among a massive labor pool.\nCons:\nManagement Responsibility: Requires effective communication and management to integrate remote workers seamlessly with in-house teams.\nPotential for Misalignment: If not managed properly, there can be discrepancies in work culture and expectations.\nPros and Cons of Outsourcing\nPros:\nFlexibility: Outsourcing can allows you to stop and start a resource at any time with no commitment.\nFocus on Core Activities: Frees up internal resources to focus on strategic business areas by delegating non-core tasks to experts.\nExpertise and Efficiency: Outsourcing partners often have specialized knowledge and experience, ensuring high-quality outcomes.\nCons:\nLess Control: Companies may have limited influence over how outsourced tasks are executed, leading to potential mismatches in expectations.\nCommunication Challenges: Time zone differences and language barriers can impede effective collaboration.\nStatistics and Insights into Global Outsourcing Trends\nAccording to Deloitte's Global Survey, 65% of businesses cited cost reduction as a primary reason for outsourcing. This highlights the financial benefits that drive companies to outsource various functions. Even greater cost savings could be found in outstaffing if the company is willing to take on the responsibility for performance and the long-term commitment of the resource.\nA report by Grand View Research predicts the global business process outsourcing (BPO) market will reach $343.2 billion by 2025, underscoring the growing reliance on outsourcing and outstaffing to optimize business operations.\n\"Outstaffing provides businesses with the agility to expand their teams quickly while retaining control over project outcomes, making it an ideal choice for dynamic industries,\" says Sarah Johnson, a tech consultant at Innovate Solutions.\nNavigating the Trade-Off, Why Choose Outstaffing?\nChoosing between outstaffing and outsourcing depends on your company's priorities and goals. If maintaining control and direct oversight of projects is crucial, outstaffing offers the ability to manage remote teams effectively. On the other hand, outsourcing provides a streamlined solution if flexibility and speed of starting a project are paramount. If you want to chat about your specific needs, we are happy to walk you through all your options. Contact us here.\nFor businesses navigating this decision, consider the following factors:\nProject Complexity: For highly specialized projects requiring niche skills, outstaffing may better suit your needs.\nBudget: Long-term Outstaffing can be substantially less expensive than outsourcing, as you choose your specific team and do not pay for the non-billable time baked into all outsourcing hourly rates.\nLong-Term Goals: Assess your business objectives and determine which model aligns best with your growth strategy.\nIn conclusion, both outstaffing and outsourcing present unique advantages and challenges. By understanding the trade-offs between flexibility and savings, businesses can make informed decisions that drive success in today's competitive landscape. At Zibtek, we have seen that more companies want greater control over what type of experience and how much experience each resource has instead of trusting an outsourced provider to deliver the correct talent level on a project. We have seen the outstaffing model work really well with software developers, accounting, marketing, and data entry.\nFor more insights and tailored solutions to enhance your business operations, we would love to understand your needs and help you evaluate the best solution for your business.

Angular is an all-inclusive front‑end framework with tooling built-in—no external meta-framework needed.\n2. Is React better than Angular in 2025?\nIt depends on your needs. React+Next.js excels in flexibility, SEO, and rapid iteration. Angular offers structure, enterprise-level tools, and scale. Both are strong contenders in the React vs Angular debate.\n3. Which is easier to learn—React with Next.js or Angular?\nStarting with React is easier for JavaScript developers. Adding Next.js adds minimal complexity. Angular has a steeper learning curve due to TypeScript, RxJS, and its opinionated style—but it’s powerful once mastered.\n4. Can I switch between Angular and React (or React+Next.js)?\nYes—with planning. Zibtek helps teams transition smoothly between front-end frameworks, minimizing downtime and preserving code quality.

    "extractedText": "Software Development Trends 2025: Insights for Small Businesses\nVedant Vyas\nRead more posts by this author.\nVEDANT VYAS\n10 JUL 2025 • 5 MIN READ\nImagine you're a small business owner gearing up to launch a new product. You’ve got a great idea, a committed team, and a deadline that’s fast approaching. But then the trouble kicks in—outdated tools, fragmented systems, slow development cycles. This is the familiar friction many small businesses face as they try to innovate.\nIn the present times, the answer to these challenges lies in embracing the most important software development trends 2025. These trends are reshaping the way companies build, scale, and secure their software. Far from being mere buzzwords, emerging technologies in software like AI coding agents, platform engineering, DevSecOps, and 5G IoT represent tangible solutions to real-world problems. Especially for small business technology, these trends offer smarter ways to grow.\nZibtek, a trusted name in custom software development, is already helping companies lead the charge by implementing real-world solutions aligned with software development trends 2025. We don’t just follow the trends—we integrate them into tailored strategies that power results.\nIn this blog, we explore how these innovations can reshape your development roadmap—and how Zibtek turns emerging trends into your competitive advantage.\nWhy Embracing Software Development Trends 2025 is Critical for Small Business Technology\nLet’s say you're running a growing ecommerce brand. Sales are up, your customer base is expanding—but behind the scenes, your technology is struggling to keep pace. Pages load slowly, your app crashes during traffic spikes, and integrating new tools takes weeks.\nFor many small businesses, this scenario is a wake-up call. The latest software development trends 2025 offer a roadmap to modernize and scale without overextending budgets or teams. From AI coding agents that write clean code faster to platform engineering that streamlines internal workflows, these innovations can help you do more with less.\nZibtek specializes in bridging this gap. We translate complex software technologies into real-world solutions—solutions that are scalable, secure, and aligned with your goals. Whether you’re upgrading legacy systems or building from scratch, Zibtek helps you move from reactive to proactive.\nLet’s dive into the software development trends 2025 that are transforming how businesses operate and grow.\nAI Coding Agents: A Game-Changer in Emerging Technologies in Software\nAI coding agents have embedded into mainstream development practices.

These frameworks streamline processes, giving developers easy access to the resources they need.\nZibtek helps businesses build custom IDPs—tailored toolkits that reduce friction and boost productivity. Whether it's pre-configured development environments or CI/CD pipelines, we build platforms that scale alongside your ambitions.\nAs one of the most impactful software technologies, platform engineering is changing the way development teams operate.

    "extractedText": "Top ReactJS Features Every Product Manager Should Know\nExplore the top ReactJS features every product manager should know. Learn how these features enhance development efficiency, improve user experience, and provide a competitive edge. Stay ahead in the tech landscape with our in-depth guide.\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n24 JUN 2024 • 5 MIN READ\nReactJS has become a cornerstone in modern web development, powering some of the most dynamic and high-performing applications on the internet, like Netflix, Facebook, Twitter, and Salesforce. As a product manager, understanding the key features of ReactJS can provide you with insights into how this technology can enhance your product’s development and user experience. Here’s a look at the top ReactJS features every product manager should know.\n1. Component-Based Architecture\nReactJS is built on a component-based architecture, which allows developers to create reusable UI components. This modular approach simplifies the development process and ensures consistency across the application.\nAccording to a survey by Stack Overflow, 40% of developers prefer using React for its component-based architecture.\nThis feature accelerates development time, reduces errors, and makes managing and scaling applications easier. To help illustrate, think of a ReactJS application as a modular construction kit, where each module or component can be independently developed, tested, and reused. Here’s a visual analogy to help you grasp the concept:\nBuilding a House with Modular Rooms\nImagine you are building a house. Instead of constructing it as a single unit, you design it room by room. Each room serves a specific purpose, and you can customize, move, or replace any room without disrupting the others. This is similar to how ReactJS uses components.\nComponents of a Simple Blog Application\n1. App (The House)\nThe App is the main container that holds all the rooms (components) together, just like a house containing all the rooms.\n2. Header (The Roof)\nThe Header is like the roof of the house. It’s a distinct part that covers and provides structure to the entire house, displaying the title or branding of the blog.\n3. PostList (The Living Room)\nThe PostList acts like the living room where guests (posts) gather. It holds and organizes multiple posts, displaying them in a coherent list.\n4. Post (Individual Furniture Pieces)\nEach Post is like a piece of furniture in the living room. Every piece (post) has its own design and function, but they all come together to create a comfortable and functional living space.\n5. Footer (The Foundation)\nThe Footer is like the foundation of the house, providing stability and essential information, such as contact details or copyright notices.\nAs a product manager, this means faster time-to-market and more reliable updates.\n2. Virtual DOM\nFirst of all what the heck is the DOM? The DOM, or Document Object Model, is like a blueprint for a web page that your web browser uses to organize and display everything you see on the screen. It turns the HTML code into a structured format that allows scripts and programs to interact with and update the content, layout, and structure of the website dynamically. Essentially, it acts as a bridge between the web page's design and how you interact with it, enabling real-time changes and interactions.\nReactJS uses a Virtual DOM to improve performance. The Virtual DOM is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM. When the state of an object changes, React updates only the Virtual DOM and then efficiently updates the real DOM, reducing costly DOM operations.\nReactJS Virtual Dom Stats\nStudies have shown that React’s Virtual DOM can improve performance by up to 60% compared to traditional DOM manipulation techniques.\nDom Example: Shopping List\nTo help understand the Dom, imagine you have a shopping list on a whiteboard. Every time you need to update the list, you follow these steps:\n1. Erase the entire list.\n2. Rewrite the entire list with the updated items.\nThis approach works but can be time-consuming and inefficient, especially if you're making frequent updates.\nImagine you have a digital version of your shopping list on a tablet. With this digital list, you can:\n1. Compare the new list with the old list.\n2. Only update the items that have changed.\nThis method is much faster and more efficient because you only make changes where necessary rather than rewriting the entire list. For product managers, this translates to smoother user experiences and improved application performance, which are critical for user retention and satisfaction.\n3. Unidirectional Data Flow\nReactJS utilizes a unidirectional data flow, meaning data flows in one direction, making it easier to debug and understand. This design leads to better control over the data and the state of the application because the data flow is predictable and easier to trace.\nReactJS Unidrectional Data Flow Stat\nA survey by The State of JavaScript reported that 58% of developers find React’s unidirectional data flow simpler and more predictable compared to other frameworks.\nReactJS utilizes a unidirectional data flow, where data flows in one direction from parent to child components. You may be wondering, but don't all Javascript frameworks do the same thing?\nWhile React is not unique in employing unidirectional data flow—both Angular and Vue.js also use this approach to some extent—React stands out due to its simplicity and the way it encourages a clear separation of concerns. Here’s how React compares:\nSimplicity and Flexibility: React’s unidirectional data flow is straightforward and doesn't impose a lot of structure, allowing developers to build applications in a more flexible and modular way. In contrast, Angular’s two-way data binding can introduce complexity in larger applications, though Angular also supports unidirectional data flow through its \"OnPush\" change detection strategy.\nState Management: React’s ecosystem includes libraries like Redux and MobX, which are designed to work seamlessly with its unidirectional data flow, providing robust solutions for state management. These tools help manage the state of large applications more predictably and efficiently.\nVue.js: Vue also supports unidirectional data flow and has a reactivity system that can track dependencies automatically. However, Vue’s approach to reactivity can sometimes introduce complexity when scaling up, whereas React’s explicit state management can offer more control in larger applications.\nIn summary, while Angular and Vue also utilize unidirectional data flow, React is often praised for its simplicity and the strength of its ecosystem in managing application state effectively. This makes React particularly well-suited for large-scale applications where maintainability and predictability are crucial.\nThis predictability and ease of debugging are crucial for maintaining high-quality standards in your product and reducing large downtime debugging nasty hidden issues.\nConclusion\nUnderstanding these key features of ReactJS can empower product managers to make informed decisions about their tech stack, ensuring that their products are built using robust, efficient, and scalable technology. ReactJS not only enhances the development process but also significantly improves the user experience and SEO performance of web applications.\nBy leveraging ReactJS’s strengths, product managers can ensure their products stand out in the competitive digital landscape, offering superior performance and user satisfaction.\nFor more insights on ReactJS development, visit our frequently asked questions.

Node.js and Apache HTTP Server are two widely used technologies, but they serve very different purposes in the world of web development. Understanding their key differences and strengths can help you decide which is better suited for your project needs.\nWhat is Apache HTTP Server?\nApache HTTP Server, commonly known as Apache, is one of the oldest and most reliable web servers available. It is designed to serve HTTP content and handle large volumes of static data efficiently. Apache is a project of the Apache Software Foundation and has been a popular choice for hosting websites since the 1990s.\nNode.js and Apache: Core Differences\nArchitecture:\nNode.js is a runtime environment that allows you to write server-side applications in JavaScript. It is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient for real-time applications.\nApache operates as a traditional web server. It creates a new thread for each request, which can be resource-intensive under high traffic, potentially leading to slower response times unless properly managed.\nPerformance:\nNode.js is highly efficient for applications that require real-time processing and high concurrency. Its non-blocking architecture allows it to handle numerous simultaneous connections with minimal overhead.\nApache is optimized for serving static content and can be very powerful in this regard, especially when configured correctly. However, its thread-based model can consume more resources and may not scale as efficiently as Node.js for dynamic content under heavy loads.\nUse Cases:\nNode.js excels in building fast, scalable network applications such as streaming platforms, real-time collaboration tools, and single-page applications (SPAs). It’s also ideal for developing server-side APIs that handle asynchronous data flow.\nApache is best suited for serving static websites and can be part of a larger stack that includes database servers and scripting languages like PHP. It’s a robust choice for traditional web hosting.\nCommunity and Ecosystem:\nNode.js benefits from a large, active community and a modern ecosystem of tools and frameworks, such as Express.js, which simplify the development of complex applications.\nApache also has a strong community and a wealth of modules that extend its functionality, from security enhancements to performance optimization.\nScalability:\nNode.js offers great scalability options out of the box, which makes it suitable for applications that expect growth in user numbers and data processing needs.\nApache can scale well but often requires more hardware resources or a detailed configuration to optimize performance under load.\nIs nodejs a webserver?\nWith just a few lines of JavaScript. This is one of its powerful features, allowing developers to build custom web server solutions tailored to their specific needs without relying on traditional web servers like Apache or Nginx.\nHere’s how it works: Node.js uses the http module, which can be used to create an HTTP server. This server can listen to server requests on a given port, creating a lightweight server without additional software. Here's a simple example of creating a web server with Node.js:\nconst http = require('http');\nconst server = http.createServer((req, res) => { res.statusCode = 200; res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain'); res.end('Hello World\\n');\n});\nserver.listen(3000, '127.0.0.1', () => { console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/');\n});\nThis script will start a web server that listens on port 3000 and responds with \"Hello World\" to all incoming requests.\nWhile Node.js provides the tools necessary to build a web server, it is more accurately described as an environment that executes JavaScript code and provides an extensive library (like http, fs, net, etc.) to support the development of web applications, including the creation of a web server.\nConclusion The choice between Node.js and Apache largely depends on the specific requirements of your project. If you need a server capable of handling dynamic, interactive applications with high levels of user engagement, Node.js is likely the better choice. However, for serving static content or traditional web applications, Apache provides proven reliability.\nIf you're planning a new project and considering Node.js or Apache, or if you need help optimizing your current setup, Zibtek can help.

This ensures that not only is the platform free to use, but it also benefits from the contributions of a large community of developers. These contributions help in the continuous improvement and evolution of the platform, making it more robust and feature-rich over time.\nKey Benefits of Using Node.js\nSingle Programming Language: With Node.js, you can use JavaScript on both the front-end and back-end, streamlining development processes and reducing the need to switch between languages. Node is often coupled with the MEAN stack using Angular on the front end.\nHigh Performance: Node.js uses non-blocking I/O operations, which makes it extremely efficient for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.\nScalability: It is designed with scalability in mind, offering features like the Cluster module that helps balance the load across multiple CPU cores.\nVibrant Community and Rich Ecosystem: Node.js enjoys a vibrant community, which contributes to a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, enhancing its functionality and making development faster and more efficient.\nFlexibility: There are no strict conventions, meaning developers have the freedom to build their applications as they see fit, using the best practices they prefer.\nCommon Use Cases for Node.js\nWeb Applications: It is particularly powerful for building web applications, from small-scale projects to large, enterprise-level solutions.\nReal-time Applications: Node.js excels in real-time applications like chat applications or live updates due to its asynchronous event-driven architecture.\nAPI Services: It's a popular choice for building RESTful APIs that serve data to mobile or web applications.\nWhat is Node.js Used For?\nNode.js is renowned for its exceptional capabilities in building fast and scalable network applications. It is particularly known for the following features:\nAsynchronous and Event-Driven: Node.js uses non-blocking, event-driven architecture, making it particularly suited for data-intensive real-time applications that operate across distributed devices.\nSingle Programming Language: It allows developers to use JavaScript both on the client-side and the server-side, which simplifies development and speeds up project completion by eliminating the need to use different programming languages for server-side and client-side scripts.\nVibrant Community: With one of the largest ecosystems of open-source libraries available through the npm registry, Node.js benefits from a vibrant community that continuously contributes to its development, providing a wealth of modules and tools that enhance its functionality.\nSuitable for Microservices: Thanks to its lightweight and modular design, Node.js is ideal for building microservices architectures, allowing businesses to scale part of their server application independently of others.\nThis unique combination of features makes Node.js a popular choice among developers for creating efficient, modern web applications that require robust server-side capabilities.\nWhat is the Difference Between Node.js and JavaScript?\nNode.js and JavaScript are closely related but serve different roles in web development. Understanding their differences is key to utilizing them effectively in your projects.\nJavaScript is a programming language that was initially designed to run in browsers to make web pages interactive. It's a versatile, high-level language used for client-side scripting, but it's also increasingly used on the server-side.\nNode.js is not a programming language; rather, it's a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be run on the server side. It's built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and enables developers to use JavaScript to write command-line tools and server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.\nKey Differences:\nEnvironment: JavaScript runs in browsers and manipulates webpage content, interfacing with HTML and CSS. Node.js runs on the server, handling tasks like connecting to a database and managing file systems.\nCapabilities: While JavaScript alone is used for front-end development, Node.js expands JavaScript's reach to back-end development, allowing developers to build full-stack applications with a single programming language.\nUse Cases: JavaScript is ideal for adding interactive behaviors to web pages, such as handling user inputs, animations, and data validation. Node.js is used for building server-side applications, APIs, and handling HTTP requests.\nIn essence, Node.js enhances JavaScript's capabilities by enabling it to do everything that traditional server-side scripts can do, providing a unified platform for developing both the client and server parts of web applications.\nWhy is NodeJS so famous?\nNode.js has gained immense popularity and has become a staple in modern web development for several reasons. Here’s a breakdown of why it's so famous:\nJavaScript Universality: One of the primary reasons for Node.js's fame is its use of JavaScript, one of the most popular programming languages. Since JavaScript is already widely used for client-side scripting, Node.js enables developers to write both client-side and server-side code in the same language. This universality simplifies development and reduces the learning curve, making it easier for new developers to pick up and for teams to maintain consistency across their codebase.\nAsynchronous and Non-blocking I/O: Node.js operates on a single-threaded event loop that uses non-blocking I/O calls, allowing it to handle many operations simultaneously without waiting for any to complete. This makes it particularly suitable for building fast, scalable network applications such as real-time communication apps and games.\nPerformance: Built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, Node.js is designed for speed. It compiles JavaScript into native machine code before execution, leading to efficient performance for server-side applications.\nNPM Ecosystem: Node.js comes with npm (Node Package Manager), which is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries that you can use to extend the capabilities of your Node.js applications. This vast repository provides modules and packages that can be easily integrated to add new functionalities, reducing development time and effort.\nCommunity and Corporate Support: Node.js has a robust and active community that contributes to its continuous improvement. Furthermore, it is supported by major companies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, which use and promote Node.js for various applications. Such backing ensures ongoing development and stability of the platform.\nSuitable for Microservices Architecture: Because of its lightweight nature and modularity, Node.js is ideal for microservices architecture—a design approach to build a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms. This is increasingly popular in enterprise applications for its scalability and flexibility.\nReal-Time Capabilities: Node.js excels in building applications that require real-time capabilities like online gaming, chat applications, and live updates. Its event-driven architecture is well-suited for such tasks where speed and reliability are crucial.\nThese features make Node.js a powerful tool for developing efficient, scalable, and high-performance web applications, contributing to its fame and widespread adoption among developers around the world.\nConclusion\nNode.js stands out as an exemplary choice for web developers looking to leverage the power of JavaScript across their entire stack. Its open-source nature, coupled with its robust features and broad community support, makes it an indispensable tool in modern web development.\nWhether you’re building a startup MVP or a complex enterprise solution, Node.js offers the performance, scalability, and flexibility you need to succeed.

    "extractedText": "SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT\nSoftware Development Services\nIan J.H Reynolds\nExplore Ian J.H Reynolds' expertise in finance and economics through his insightful articles on market trends, investment strategies, and economic analysis.\nMore posts by Ian J.H Reynolds.\nIAN J.H REYNOLDS\n13 MAY 2020 • 6 MIN READ\nAdvancements in software have revolutionized the way we connect with our loved ones and conduct business. Never before has it been so important for business owners to rely on robust software solutions to streamline their operations and increase efficiency. However, it's not possible for every organization to have an in-house software development team.\nIt can be prohibitively expensive to maintain one, and some companies just don't have enough financial leeway to make that kind of an investment. In that case, they can just outsource the job to a company that provides software development services.\nWhat is a software development service?\nYou might be wondering what exactly does a software company do? Most companies have a specific area of focus, for example, some might focus on mobile or web development while others might have expertise in creating custom software solutions.\nIn addition to these services, these companies can also help develop business analytics and intelligence tools as well as provide consultancy services to organizations that are looking to get more out of the existing software solutions that they have in place.\nThere are countless service providers in the market that operate solely to provide software development services to clients. These companies are hired by businesses to perform a wide range of services that may include development of new projects, quality assurance, user testing, database management, and more.\nSoftware development service providers can help you take a project from concept to reality. They have the resources, equipment and expertise required to execute your project. Hiring one frees you from having to make significant investments in getting your own development team established, a process that can often end up pushing back the timeline for your project.\nWhen do you need a software development service?\nThere are more than a few scenarios where you might feel the need to hire a software development service, it primarily depends on your business goals and exactly what you’re looking to get developed.\nYou might require a custom software solution to track inventory in your warehouse or you might want to have an app created for your restaurant that allows your customers to place their orders for pickup.\nA software development service will also be required if you’re looking to launch a new website, whether it’s just a single landing page that highlights the salient features of your product or a full-fledged ecommerce store complete with shopping cart and payment gateway integrations.\nThe entire process behind creating custom software solutions is very complex. It goes through many different stages that involve design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance. That’s why it’s important to outsource the work to a dedicated service provider so that it gets done right the first time.\nTypes of software development\nMobile apps\nMost consumer-facing businesses prefer having mobile apps because of the rapid shift that the smartphone industry has seen over the past decade. Countless studies have found that customers on mobile are more likely to engage and shop with a business. Retail app usage has surged by 50 percent since 2016.\nNo wonder, then, that a vast majority of the service providers list mobile app development as one of their areas of expertise. The benefits that mobile apps provide aren’t just limited to consumer-facing businesses.\nYou can also utilize apps to track the efficiency of teams in your organization, manage fleet in a logistics operation, track inventory in a warehouse, and more.\nSoftware\nThe business needs for every organization are unique so it’s not uncommon that the software solution they require doesn’t come in a one size fits all package. This is where software development service providers play their part.\nA good service provider will be able to understand the needs and requirements of the business and will then be able to create custom software solutions, whether it’s a case management system for a law firm or a guest management system for a bed & breakfast.\nWeb apps\nWeb apps are fundamentally different from mobile apps. A web app is basically a specifically designed website that offers a native user experience on mobile devices. They carry out their tasks through the device's browser.\nThey are particularly handy because there's no need to download or install anything to have a web app running on your device. That's why they're preferred by many organizations. They're also easier to maintain for developers since they have one common codebase, there's no need to have different versions for different mobile platforms.\nCloud apps\nAs the name suggests, a cloud app is one that runs in the cloud. What that means is that most of the processing logic and data storage is done off the device and on a remote server.\nThis significantly reduces compatibility requirements for users as all they need in most cases to run apps that their devices wouldn't normally support is little more than a web browser and an internet connection.\nFull range of software development services\nA great way of judging the capabilities of the service provider you choose is by looking at the services that they provide. A full-fledged development firm will be able to provide the following core services, in addition to many others.\nIT consulting\nOrganizations that are not reliant on technology or those looking to make significant changes to their systems may be unsure about how to proceed. They may not want to upset the proverbial apple cart and end up causing disruption to their business.\nIn that case, they require IT consultancy services whereby an outside company can advise them on how and which technologies they should use in order to achieve their business goals in the most efficient and cost-effective way possible.\nMaintenance services\nThe development team's job isn't done the moment they deploy the software. It's highly imperative to have continuous maintenance of software applications so as to ensure that they remain protected against vulnerabilities, don't suffer from performance issues and are periodically improved as well with feature addition.\nMany service providers thus offer complete software maintenance services which are aimed at making sure that all software applications remain fully functional, free of bugs and glitches.\nSoftware testing and QA\nOnce the development team has built the software solution based on the customer's requirements, it needs to be properly tested first before it can be deployed. This is a crucial step that's meant to find out if any bugs exist in the software that need to be fixed before the full-scale deployment.\nQuality assurance is a highly important part of the software development lifecycle as it's meant to figure out if the deliverable meets the quality requirements of the client, and to be certain that quality was not sacrificed during the development process just to complete objectives or meet deadlines.\nDedicated development centers\nMany organizations prefer outsourcing their work to a dedicated development team. They do that for the peace of mind that the service provider has a separate team earmarked for them that exclusively works on their project. Even if they’re not maintaining internal development teams, this model offers them more control over the developers working on their project.\nThe provision of dedicated developer centers allows service providers, especially those with a vast talent pool, to be competitive in the market. Businesses that prefer such an arrangement get the flexibility to choose and manage their dedicated team or they can leave it all up to the service provider.\nFind the right software development service for your needs.\nIt’s important to understand that not all software development services providers are created equal. The quality of the work done greatly depends on the capabilities and limitations of the company that you choose.\nThat’s why Zibtek has long been preferred by companies big and small, from Fortune 500s to startups, for any and all software development needs. Its custom business software solutions include mobile app development, web development, UI and UX design as well as digital marketing services.\nZibtek also has a team of quality assurance experts that can help organizations establish robust testing procedures while its dedicated QA teams can provide scripted and manual testing services to ensure end-to-end quality of software applications.\nSales-focused organizations can benefit from its CRM development services. Its flexible CRM services can improve customer satisfaction, help reduce costs and drive growth through intelligent tracking and analytics tools.\nWhile it might be appealing to outsource your business to an offshore service provider, chances are that they might be able to provide the level of personalized service that Zibtek can.\nYou see, Zibtek has offices in Salt Lake City as well as a global network of highly experienced developers that are managed from the United States. With offices in the Philippines and India as well, it also offers you a truly global talent pool to draw resources from, whether that be for quality assurance or for a dedicated development team.\nSo reach out to the team at Zibtek today and find out how they can help create custom software solutions that take your business to the next level.

    "extractedText": "When and How to Split a Scrum Dev Team\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n5 FEB 2021 • 4 MIN READ\nHow to Split Developers Team\nWhen is the Best Time To Split My Scrum Dev Team?\nThere comes a time when it makes sense to split your scrum dev team. This happens as a company wants to create efficiency in the workplace. When a scrum team is too large, productivity declines as team members will tend to be counterproductive and step on each other’s toes. As the number of individuals grows, natural subgroups will start to form, but compared to proactively solving the problem, these natural subgroups don’t hold the same value.\nThe length and the order of daily meetings is a valid indicator of when your scrum team is too large. It’s important to save valuable time by conducting meetings with information that is applicable to everyone in participation. When a scrum team starts to have meetings with various instructions for multiple different people, you will find that your team is too large. A split is often recommended once you’ve hit 7-8 people.\nOnce you have decided that your team is in need of a split, the question arises of\n“How should I effectively split my scrum dev team?” Zibtek uses a practical agile style process with three fundamental steps.\nSteps to Split Your Scrum Dev Team:\nStep 1: Create Maturity Metrics\nThe first step to take when splitting your software engineering team is to analyze the performance of each team member. In this process, you will rate each individual on a scale of 1-5 in each area of expertise, 1 being the weakest area, and 5 being phenomenal or an expert in that specific skill.\nIt’s important that the scoring scale isn’t too large because it will oftentimes be difficult to determine a specific score when given a wide range. For example, the brain will provide a less accurate score with a range of 10 because our brains analyze better on smaller scales.\nThe skills that you decide to evaluate fully depends on the requirements for your project. Some of the skill sets that we have found beneficial to assess in a typical web project are MongoDB, Angular, Node, UI, and communication.\nIt’s crucial to take the time to individually evaluate each engineer and all of his/her skill sets. This process of scoring each team member for the multiple different areas of expertise is what Zibtek calls creating “maturity metrics”.\nThrough developing maturity metrics, and assessing the strengths and weaknesses that each team member exemplifies, it will be clear to identify which skill sets you can utilize for each team. After this step, it will become more direct as to how to begin setting up efficient and versatile teams.\nHow maturity metrics can help a career path for an engineer:\nNot only can maturity metrics play a role in diverging a sizable, counterproductive team, but it can also assist the engineer in finding a career path, as well as motivating themselves to improve in certain skill sets. Through the visual representation of being “scored” on a variety of skills, it will be apparent what to work on and strive towards. This process of creating maturity metrics is ultimately training goal-oriented, driven coders.\nSplitting Your Scrum Development Team\nStep 2: Arrange The Teams\nNow that each member of the scrum development team has been evaluated and scored, it is time to start arranging teams. The goal is to construct a team that has high scoring engineers for each skill, as well as teams that have a similar total when adding up all of the maturity metrics.\nBy balancing the variety of skill sets amongst multiple different teams, the company will find itself to be more efficient as each team will be able to approach all aspects of the project, instead of simply specializing in one skill. The most efficient way to begin this process is to place all of the names and scores in a spreadsheet, as this image depicts.\nThis spreadsheet will provide a clear depiction of which team needs which skill set. With the numbers being visually placed in a systematic format, it’s a convenient way to hypothesize which engineers’ skills will complement each other. This process is solely data-driven, which may seem as though there should be no room for error, but there are often other factors that come into play which is the reasoning for the third step of this process.\nStep 3: Consider Other Factors\nThe final step of this process is to take into consideration all of the other factors that could result in a successful team. Oftentimes certain personalities or situations can play a role in the efficiency of the group. There may be certain scenarios, such as engineers who rely on each other for questions or advice as well as personalities that clash. All of which could play a role while choosing how to split the team. It is vital to maintain or create a strong work environment, especially during this time of change when the team is dividing.\nAlthough this whole procedure initially started with using data and numbers, it is key to finish the system by incorporating human interactions and emotions. You want the engineers to have positive experiences with the people they work with. Ultimately, this final step is integral to the whole process because it’s the key component of transforming this procedure into a practical agile approach.\nHow does this process fit into Zibtek’s practical agile style?\nThrough this unique process, it is apparent how Zibtek incorporates this practical agile method into every aspect of the company. The style is used not only with customer relations but also amongst the company to create a positive working environment. We have found that including employee needs in our data-driven process results in the most productive progression.\nThis procedure taken to split the team follows along with a phrase in the Agile Manifesto that states, “Individuals and interactions over processes and tools”. We have implemented this phrase into the actions we have taken to divide teams, but we have not taken it to an extreme. Our process doesn’t solely rely on the friendships within the company or the situations employees find themselves in. As a company, we have made an effort to divide our team systematically through maturity metrics, but also incorporating agile methods, thus resulting in a practical agile approach.

    "extractedText": "PRACTICAL AGILE\nKanban vs Scrum: Maximizing the Efficiency Of Software For Your Business\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n16 FEB 2021 • 6 MIN READ\nAs a startup, Fortune 500 business, or a business anywhere in between, having well-designed software that drives revenue, reduces costs and streamlines your interaction with clients is fundamental to your business' growth. As a small business owner, having personalized software to meet your business' needs can give you the limitless potential for scaling up your company and gaining an edge over your competitors.\nTo create customized business software that maximizes productivity, companies need to work in tandem with software developers or tech companies, usually using Agile software development methodology to turn a vision for a business need into a software solution. Agile can be best described as a simple and effective process of developing software that employs regular team collaboration (between the business owner and the developer) and encourages a flexible response to change. Agile manages the software development process for businesses by breaking it into stages that require constant stakeholder collaboration and continuous improvement at every step.\nSoftware developers usually use one of two Agile methodologies—the Kanban approach or the Scrum, also known as the Sprint approach, to maximize efficiency and get the best software possible for a business. Both methods have merits and demerits, and knowing which one to use at any given time is crucial in developing efficient software for your business.\nIn certain instances, people have mixed the two approaches to getting work done. We'll focus on the difference between the two methods, and by the end of this article, you can evaluate them from both a business and a developer's perspective. You should also be able to identify which situations would require any of the two approaches. But before we can delve into this, let's first examine what these approaches stand for and their similarities.\nWhat Is The Kanban Method?\nTo start with, Kanban is a Japanese word that means \"visual board.\" Using visual impressions to track projects is a part of the Kanban method as it is for the Sprint method as well. Overall, the Kanban method visualizes workflow to reduce the total amount of time spent on the project. The Kanban philosophy says, \"start with what you do now and use continuous improvement to achieve evolutionary change.\" It requires that teams keep optimizing their Kanban board as situations change. Thus with Kanban, the team works on one item at a time before proceeding to the next item without setting any strict weekly goals to meet. Hence, team members cannot predict when certain tasks will be completed. This method is simpler than Scrum and is fast and flexible though it is unpredictable.\nWhat Is The Scrum Or Sprint Method?\nThe Scrum method works on the principle that dividing projects into short segments is the best way to maximize productivity. It is used to divide work into smaller parts within a prescribed period termed as a Sprint. Thus, Scrum is a large set that can contain several sprints. Sprints refer to a short, fixed time frame within which a Scrum team has to complete a specified amount of work with milestones that they need to achieve or track. A sprint generally lasts 2-4 weeks.\nLet's now look at some similarities and differences between the two methods.\nKanban vs scrum\nSimilarities Between Kanban and Sprint\nThe two methods both share Agile values used to organize work between collaborating team members. For instance, in developing software, the product owner, scrum master, and the development team must work together. Kanban and Sprint methods both provide frameworks within which team members—whether clearly defined or not, must act to make workflow more efficient to yield the best result possible. Both are centered on self-organized teams that break down work into smaller pieces. They both encourage openness and transparency to improve every step of project execution.\nCritical Differences In Using Kanban Versus Sprint In Software Teams\nThe most fundamental difference between Kanban and Scrum is that Kanban gives team members the flexibility to go with the project's natural flow, without time limits, while Scrum uses sprints. Sprints give teams fixed deadlines to meet specific functionalities to prevent distractions, while Kanban seeks to increase efficiency using less defined times for meeting particular goals.\nSecondly, with Kanban, roles played by team members are not clearly defined and not required to be cross-functional. Contrarily, the Scrum method requires clearly defined roles. A team would typically have a Scrum Master, Product Owner and Team members.\nAnother point to note is Scrum philosophy's limitations, which do not allow for changes to occur before a sprint ends, making a Sprint very inflexible. On the other hand, the Kanban method is flexible and will enable changes to be made at any time.\nWhen To Use Kanban vs Scrum?\nWhile Scrum/Sprints are great for every team type, they are recommended for more experienced teams that are quite good at planning and working in Agile as tasks must be completed within a specified period/sprint.\nKanban is the best option for less experienced teams, as it is easier to use and adopt. Consequently, teams usually start with it and move to Scrum when they get better at planning. You can also try your hands on the two methods to find the right fit for your team.\n‌‌\nFrom a developer's perspective, the Kanban method can create insecurity in some team members. This insecurity can occur because software developers often construe the lack of a roadmap for completing a project as an indicator of uncertainty. The developers might think that there aren't enough jobs for them to do daily and presume that they're expendable to the team.\nA vital component for every successful business software development project is the team at the helm of affairs. You need to carefully choose who to hire to translate your business' needs into a software's design. Choosing the right team and adding a little planning would go a long way in reducing avoidable mistakes. It is essential to work with the best software development practices.\nConclusion\nBoth methods come with advantages and disadvantages. Your choice of development approach would depend on the specific business needs and the level of your team's experience and most importantly, the type of product you are building. For instance, the approach required for building a marketing website is different from that required for developing an accounting software. When torn between the two methods, you could let your team vote, reach a consensus, or consult an expert software developer.\nZibtek is a custom software developing company with on-demand industry veteran developers who can help your business capture a worldwide audience's attention with optimized business software, security and advisory solutions.

The purpose of sprint planning is for everyone to agree on a goal for the next sprint and the set of backlog items to achieve it. Backlog grooming sessions are a critical part of agile software development with Scrum. As part of our development process, Zibtek is always grooming to ensure priorities are set and the backlog is in the best possible shape for sprint planning.\nBacklog Grooming and Sprint Planning\nWhat is backlog grooming, and how do you “groom” it?\nSo to start explaining about backlog grooming and sprint planning we'll start with the backlog. A backlog is the process and session where items of backlog are discussed. A backlog is simply the list of everything required to build a complete product. It includes features, user requirements, and potential bugs. In agile software development, there are typically two types of backlogs: product and sprint. The sprint backlog contains the highest priority items from the product backlog.\nBefore a story is ready for sprint planning, it needs to be “groomed.” With the product owner, the development team decides the sprint’s goals, duration, and story points. The development team then chooses what should be prioritized in the sprint backlog.\nThe primary purpose of a sprint backlog is to help a development team stay focused on only the most crucial items that need working on.\nBacklog Grooming\nThe backlog grooming process\nIn the course of the development process, a sprint backlog grows ever bigger. Backlog grooming keeps it organized. Before a sprint planning meeting, product owners should review the backlog to ensure:\nThe set priorities are correct.\nThe prioritized items have all the correct information.\nThe feedback from previous meetings has been incorporated.\nWhile in theory backlogs should only contain prioritized items, in many cases they end up a dumping ground for all ideas, feature, and bug requests. The backlog can quickly become overcrowded and out of control. To keep it relevant, grooming refines the backlog by cutting out unimportant stories and tasks and maintaining only priority ones. So be conscious about not cluttering up your backlog with too much information when you're considering backlog grooming vs sprint planning.\nKey backlog grooming activities include:\nEliminating unwanted user stories that don’t fit the current product direction.\nReprioritizing stories to move lower priority items to the bottom of the backlog.\nBreaking down large work items into smaller ones.\nUpdating estimates.\nAdding new work items.\nThe benefits of frequent backlog grooming quickly become apparent as development teams can readily access all the information they need to put together a sprint action plan.\nBacklog Grooming vs Sprint Planning\nHow grooming meetings fit into the sprint planning process\nTrimmed and well-maintained backlogs help development teams be more productive during sprint planning meetings. In fact, we hold grooming sessions two to three times a weeking for a typical project because of the impact they’ve had on our sprint planning meetings. Development teams that master the art of backlog grooming reap the full benefits of clear requirements, testable units of work, and correct story sizes.\nAs a leading software development company, Zibtek understands the value backlog grooming brings to sprint planning. For us, backlog grooming is not a one-off activity but one that’s regularly revisited and scheduled as an ongoing part of the Scrum development process. Our software project process is designed to make sprint meetings more productive through the use of aggressive backlog grooming.

All agile software projects have the same challenges:\nWhat the project must deliver.\nWhen it needs to be delivered.\nHow it will stay on budget.\nManaging these three constraints is a tricky juggling act, but a once-common software planning tool can help balance different variables and achieve project management nirvana: The Iron Triangle Project Management\nThe Iron Triangle vs. The Agile Approach\nAt first glance, The Iron Triangle approach looks no different from the agile software one, as its principles involve scope, schedule, and budget. That’s pretty much the three agile points we listed above, right? Yes, it is, but there’s a critical difference that dramatically separates the two. In an agile approach, speed, not scope, is the most important driver. What that means in practical terms is getting the smallest usable features workable as quickly as possible. Here’s why that matters.\nReal-World Usage vs. Hypothetical Models\nExperience tells us that no matter how much thought, planning, and speculation go into a software project when the rubber hits the road, it quickly becomes obvious some assumptions and abstract concepts aren’t going to work. In agile software projects, we focus on quickly building the things we know will work, focusing on the most critical issues to solve rather than following a pre-defined chronological path.\nWhen you release and test minimally viable products, you’re able to produce better solutions than you would if you blindly followed an initial plan you were required to stick to. Here’s an illustration of the agile approach in action. Microsoft discovered that by fixing the top 20 percent of its most reported bugs, 80 percent of related crashes and bugs in a system would be eliminated. In other words, 20 percent of the code had 80 percent of the errors!\nThis 80/20 rule, also known as the Pareto principle, can easily be applied to agile software projects. At Zibtek, we work with our clients to make sure upfront planning helps them define project priorities that get their core business objectives met in the shortest possible time.\nThe Agile Iron Triangle - Speed Without Sacrificing Quality\nSo when someone is wondering about the Agile Iron Triangle in regard to Iron Triangle Methodology, they’re often concerned about balancing speed with a strong process. Does all this speed have a negative impact on a project? It could, but done right, the answer is no. Zibtek balances speed and quality by holding strong sprint planning meetings with product owners, engineers, and quality assurance where the focus is on brainstorming ideal technical approaches to solutions and architecture. Unlike a Kanban approach, which runs fast with no thought or planning, an agile approach runs fast while still allowing for strong architecture and coding standards.\nHarmonious Project Management\nSo, are The Iron Triangle and the agile software project approaches compatible? On many levels, the answer is yes. While agile moved the needle from strictly following upfront planning to doing smaller tasks that speed up the process, most projects still follow many of the laws of The Iron Triangle, whether consciously or not. Where agile wins the day is that it gets things accomplished even as the scope of your project progresses and changes. Zibtek’s agile software project methods work for all types of software development models, including those being developed alongside products.

Once the backlog grooming is complete, we do a refinement meeting to go through each ticket in preparation for technical planning. Everyone attends this refinement meeting, including quality assurance (QA), engineers, and product owners. Together the entire team comes up with the architecture of the sprint planning meeting. By doing it this way the sprint is being done with strong agile scrum methodologies in mind.\nThis approach is far more expedient because ideas and concerns—such as whether a new API is needed or an existing one will work—can be bounced around and off one another in real-time. It’s also a great way for team members to hold one another accountable.\nSprint Planning Meetings Using Agile Scrum Development\nPeople sometimes wonder what the value of so many meetings are. Shouldn’t we just get down to coding already? But we believe:\nThe best ideas come from the whole team.\nBy holding multiple sprint planning meetings, a ton of rework and refactoring is avoided.\nIn other words, it’s an extremely powerful way of doing things that saves you from all the mess that typically comes up, particularly from QA, when jumping too quickly into the sprint planning meeting.\nUnlike the Kanban method, which is more continuous and where things are done one at a time in order of top priority, agile scrum development is based on short, structured sprints. The better those sprints are planned for, the more value you bring to the product. Of course, Kanban can sometimes be a great way to start a project. Still, we believe it’s better to move as quickly as possible into a sprint situation.\nLong story short, the more intensive planning you do before a sprint, the better your chances are for success.\nPrerequisites of a Sprint Planning Meeting\nAs they say, if you fail to plan, you plan to fail. Before jumping into the agile sprint planning, certain necessary conditions should be met:\nA prioritized backlog\nGroomed stories\nDefinition of Ready (DoR)\nPlanned capacity\nThe goal is to make the sprint less of a moving target and more of a force that leads to predictable outcomes, sustained momentum, and a sense of achievement.\nSprint Planning Meeting\nWhat Happens During a Sprint Planning Meeting?\nEach software development project is different, but a typical sprint planning meeting covers:\nNegotiating and finalizing the sprint goal.\nUnderstanding the story or stories.\nCreating and assigning tasks on individual levels.\nEstimating hours for each task.\nUpdating and validating available individual bandwidth.\nMapping dependencies and risks.\nDuring the meeting, product owners also all clarify the doubts, if any, of stories.\nThe structured flexibility of sprints allows for measured adaption to change, lets engineers more collaboratively solve problems, and facilitates the incorporation of new ideas. Through structured standups, product owners stay engaged in every step of the process so feedback is consistent and issue resolution rapid.\nThe Long Road to Successful Sprint Planning is Worth It\nThere are two main goals to a sprint planning meeting:\nAgreement on the sprint goal, or what will be delivered at the end of the sprint.\nA sprint backlog that contains a prioritized set of user stories, bugs, enhancements, tasks, and sub-tasks for the up-coming sprint.\nAs a proven leader in software development, Zibtek understands the value sprint planning meetings bring to agile software development with Scrum. As an integral part of our software project process, sprint planning meetings help align everyone on the same page while also getting the necessary infrastructure and processes in place. High-level benefits include goal and scope visibility, task discovery, improved team collaboration, and more.If you’re ready to learn more about how Zibtek’s sprint planning process helps you get the most out of your software, we invite you to check out our Software Development Comparison Guide or reach out to us today with any questions you might have.

Stories are used in Agile to capture an informal description of a software feature from the end-user’s perspective, user stories are written in natural language that encourages shifting the focus from writing about requirements to talking about them.\nWhy You Need Agile Development User Stories\nAgile user stories let you define what benefits your product brings to your target audience. At Zibtek, we use user stories to better understand what our client’s product delivers to their end-users. They’re a great tool for driving collaboration and creativity, pushing team members to find practical development solutions.\nIt can be tempting to think Agile development user stories are merely software system requirements, but they’re much more. They give the development team important context and associate tasks with the value those tasks bring. Benefits to user stories include:\nKeeping the focus on the end-user. Unlike to-do lists where tasks are checked off one by one, a story keeps the team focused on solving real user problems.\nImproved collaboration with all team members working together to decide how best to serve the end-user.\nEngineers like to solve problems. Keeping the focus on end users builds morale and gives engineers the satisfaction of seeing their code help real people.\nCreating momentum as the development team feels encouraged and motivated by small wins.\nHow to Write Great Agile Development Stories\nAgile development stories should be short, concise, containing the minimum amount of detail necessary to fully define the value the feature is meant to deliver. When writing a user story, consider the following:\nUser personas. Who is the end-user? Are there multiple users? If so, consider writing multiple stories.\nWhat you want to accomplish. Outline tasks or subtasks and decide the specific steps needed to complete them. Substacks in a story can include what the start date should be, how it should be renewed, the number of licenses to be given, etc. A dev checklist ensures tasks like boundary conditions, functionality tests, and code coverage are completed. A deployment checklist covers things like deployment times and code coverages. And a quality checklist list test to be run, such as smoke tests, regression tests, and manual testing.\nTime. We like to keep stories within eight to 10 hours. If the story is getting too large and is more than a day’s work, we split it up.\nHow a story will be split. Splitting large user stories into smaller ones improves the Scrum workflow. Many software developers split their stories horizontally, but we prefer to split them vertically. For instance, instead of breaking down features into work that has to be done at architectural layers, such as one story for UI, another for the database, etc., a horizontal splits slices into technical layers. The result is something functional gets into users' hands today. Even if isn't huge, it's one small thing that works end-to-end.\nAgile User Stories\nInvest in Agile Development User Stories\nThe acronym INVEST is often used to remember the widely accepted criteria for assessing user story quality. It stands for:\nIndependent\nNegotiable\nValuable\nEstimable\nSmall\nTestable\nZibtek can help you become Dev ready by creating Agile development user stories that improve the value of your product, estimate development efforts in a practical way, and meet the team’s definition of ready. As a software development leader, we know just how crucial user stories can be as sources of truth for both moving a project forward and keeping it on track.

No owner changes. No urgent new functionalities. And no defects. In the real world, Scrum teams deal with interruptions or disruptions during most of their sprints. How they handle them can mean the difference between meeting critical deadlines and throwing the sprint completely off.\nA question we hear a lot, typically asked by someone who wants something right now, is “if you’re agile, shouldn’t we just take care of whatever issues come up as they come up?” While sprint flexibility allows for change, it isn’t productive for a team to simply drop everything they’re working on to deal with individual questions or complaints. As with most things in life, they’d never get anything done.\nHow to Handle Sprint Interruptions\nEvery sprint is different, so it makes sense every sprint interruptions is unique as well. So instead of trying to tackle every possible interruption that might occur, it’s good to have some guidelines in place that govern how sprints are run. Here’s what we like to do to plan for and handle interruptions when they occur.\nCreate upfront rules. When it comes to sprints, flexibility and hard rules can work together. Before starting a sprint, we like to talk about everything that could potentially disrupt it. Together with the owners and engineering team, we create rules that focus on doing the minimal fix required to keep the project on track.\nLimit immediacy to strict outages. If an interruption has no workaround, is completely unreachable or broken, or is a critical function of the app, we immediately handle it.\nMinimize fixes. We typically don’t do full fixes after a disruption. If there’s a manual workaround, we do that. For instance, we had a project where some leads hadn’t made their way into the database. A good, quick solution would be to ask someone to manually enter them until we deal with the problem in the next sprint. If it can’t be done manually, we still don’t transition to doing a full fix. Instead, we’d just write a cron job with a little script that moves the leads into the right place—sort of like a hack.\nAgile Sprint Planning\nThe goal is to use a workaround when bugs come and use that workaround until the next sprint planning. So, when a disruption happens we:\nWrite a good story.\nStart our grooming process.\nGo through refinement, figuring out what caused the bug, and writing unit test coverage.\nWe’ve learned that what generally happens when these outages come is no one writes really quality code, no one searches for the root cause, and no one really fixes anything so the same disruption doesn’t happen again. You instead end up just putting in something that’s substandard. It’s a Band-Aid solution that’s inefficient in the long-term. We prefer to go through our entire process so the problem gets fixed afterward in a good way.\nMitigate Effects of Sprint Disruptions\nWhen you plan for disruptions ahead of time and put solid rules in place on how they’ll be dealt with, you set the stage for defeating the chaos that often accompanies them. A narrow focus, setting clear goals, and laying out specifics for how to handle interruptions keeps everyone and everything perfectly aligned to meet commitments and keep a project moving forward.

This is a massive benefit of the approach, but because it’s so loosely defined, items must be revisited and clearly defined before they come into the sprint. Enter sprint refinement meetings.\nAlso referred to as product backlog refinements, sprint refinement meetings ensure that once a project reaches the sprint meeting stage, it’s been well-analyzed, and the project can be moved forward in a meaningful way.\nRefinement Meetings: When and Why They Happen\nRefinement meetings help teams arrive at clearly-defined and prioritized blocks of work that can be taken forward into the next sprint. Relatively short sessions that occur after product grooming is complete, they happen right before the sprint meeting. We often hold refinement meetings on a Friday and have the sprint meeting the following Monday.\nAt a typical sprint execution refinement meeting we:\nReview stories that will be going into the next sprint.\nRun through groomed backlog items with the developers.\nAsk questions to gain clarity.\nWhat is Refinement Meetings?\nRefinement meetings are also a great opportunity for the tech guys to make contributions, giving them more ownership and enjoyment in the process. They also allow engineers to provide their input. It’s sort of like the two heads are better than one proverb, except in this case it’s many heads are better than one. Having non-tech people weigh in on possible solutions often results in discovering new ways to do something.\nFor instance, engineers tend to see problem-solving as a creative endeavor, and if there is no problem, they’ll often create one just so they can try to solve it! A “this will work here” or “how will this behave there?” contribution can spark the team to add to or take away from the product.\nAt the end of the refinement meeting, the “to do” list for the sprint is put together.\nSprint Planning Agenda\nPoor Planning Leads to Project Failure. Here are the Six factors must be met for any software project to be successful:\nOn-time delivery.\nStays within budget.\nWorks as designed.\nPeople use it.\nThe owners are happy.\nIt meets its stated goals.\nWith many different stakeholders having many different requirements, there should be little surprise that one of the top five causes of software project failure is inaccurate requirements gathering. Even under the best circumstances, requirements can be vague. For example, it can be hard for an owner to articulate all their needs until they see the end product.\nUnlike traditional waterfall development, Scrum projects treat requirements in a progressive way. For instance, details are fleshed out just enough for teams to start building functionality, and as change is expected, requirements can be manipulated. Refinement meetings set up an environment where:\nProduct features can be negotiated.\nSome requirements can be discarded in favor of something more valuable.\nMost organizations have indeed come to expect failure for their software projects. But what if that didn’t need to be? While owners, developers, project managers, and product managers can all learn from project failures, the goal should be to make those failures few and far between. Refinement meetings mitigate the risk of items failing the sprint or taking longer to complete than anticipated. They expose risk and get all team members aligned with a shared understanding of any problems. Finding the skills to run a well tuned development team can be difficult, you can outsource certain aspect to augment your team with the right resources to be more productive.\nTo learn more about Zibtek’s sprint planning process, including the role of refinement meetings, contact us online today to schedule a consultation.

We’ll take a look at what the study uncovered below, but here’s what’s notable about the company’s subsequent report. The top four reasons cited for IT development project failure then still—nearly a decade later—ring true.\nWhen Zibtek set out to establish its software development process, these four issues were top-of-mind. From pre-project consultation to launch and maintenance, we know good communication, clear requirements, and detailed planning are essential to projects meeting original goals and being completed within budget.\n5 Reasons Why IT Software Projects Fail\nAs reported by respondents to Gartner’s survey, the top four reasons IT software projects fail are:\nA change in the organization’s priorities (39%). Sometimes there’s even a failure to reach a consensus on priorities. Whatever the priority problem may be, project owners (POs) and project teams must get aligned on top project priorities. Must-haves, should-haves, and could-haves need to be clearly laid out.\nA change in project objectives (37%). It’s extremely rare for a project’s scope to be a sealed deal upfront. It’s important, of course, to define what the project’s goal is, but all projects must be able to adapt to changing business requirements during the development process. POs and teams alike must know when to pivot, or their efforts will be at best ineffective and at worst, a failure.\nInaccurate requirements gathering (35%). Clearly defined project requirements are arguably the most critical factor in an IT project’s success. POs and software developers can both be guilty of overlooking details that could potentially derail a software project. Many times, the project requirements aren’t clearly communicated, with both sides misunderstanding what’s needed. Detailed requirements exist for a good reason; they help everyone involved in the project to define clear goals and objectives and ensure the end product meets the PO’s actual expectations.\nUndefined opportunities and risks (29%). This mistake is comparable to building a house without blueprints. Every software development project contains elements of surprise and uncertainty. Negative or positive risks should be described in terms of potential effects on the project. Risk analysis, evaluation, and response planning build a framework for minimizing threats and revealing opportunities that can be maximized.\nA fifth reason, poor communication, was reported by a quarter of respondents. It’s no surprise, of course, that effective communication is crucial to any project’s success. By establishing a culture of honesty and encouraging all stakeholders to speak up about ideas, complaints, or hesitations, the blame culture that pervades many project development teams can be eliminated.\nProjects Need Less Complexity and More Governance\nThat’s the conclusion Gartner came to about why software projects fail. And that is one that Zibtek enthusiastically embraces. It’s our firm belief that proper planning can eliminate the top four failure triggers. When clients sometimes ask why a so-called Agile process requires so many planning sessions, we point out the sprint process is about structured flexibility, not a race to the finish line. By continually verifying priorities, objectives, and requirements, our engineers can adapt to change and incorporate new ideas.\nCommunication + Clear Requirements = Project Success\nZibtek believes one of the simplest ways to ensure a project stays on track is to work with a good PO who can facilitate clear communications, particularly on requirements, and help set practical expectations. Writing good [stories], backlog grooming, and [refinement meetings] are all necessary to clarify a project’s intentions and bring it to a successful launch.

While there will always be inevitable bugs, the goal is to keep them to a minimum. At Zibtek, we believe it’s more efficient and effective to build quality into the product as we go, not test the finished product to identify and fix issues. So, we use what’s called peer code review, a process where team members check each other’s code for bugs and mistakes.\nWhy Peer Code Review?\nPeer code review has been shown to accelerate and streamline the software development process as few other practices can.\nTraditional vs. Peer Code Review\nThe traditional code review process is not particularly well-liked by agile project teams. First, agile teams are self-organizing, which means skillsets span across the group. In a standard code view, the process falls to one person, typically a senior Dev or team leader. That’s a problem for someone on an agile team because:\nIt’s tedious and not considered a fun task.\nThe work takes a lot of time for one person, tying up precious time from senior talent.\nMost senior engineers don’t like code reviews. They prefer things like architecture and writing software.\nCompanies that use a traditional code review process often end up losing top talent who aren’t interested in devoting their time to what they consider to be less fun work.\nThe Zibtek Peer Code Review Process\nEveryone handles peer review a little differently. Here’s how we do peer code review process.\nZibtek’s peer code review has more people involved in the code review process, but we don’t throw the work at newbies. We let people get to a certification spot, say six months or so, where they know the product and its features well enough that we believe they can handle peer reviews. It’s a bit like a graduation, with them getting past the learning curve. It also protects the product.\nDuring the peer code review process itself we:\nLook at the coding standards, which often contain up to a hundred items.\nPrioritize five that we really want to improve.\nMake sure the person doing the review fully understands the type of code they’re reviewing. We want to avoid turning the peer code review process into a mentoring or training operation, which can increase the amount of time it takes to complete the task.\nTwo of the greatest benefits peer code review brings to the table is it:\nFacilitates knowledge sharing and exposes Devs to new ideas and processes that help them write better code.\nCuts the per-code review time down to about 15-20 minutes.\nPeople often ask how peer code review fits in with continuous development (CD) and DevOps. Doesn’t it extend the project’s end date? Done right, peer code review actually saves time in the long run. We still have CD and DevOps set up, we just set a trigger or manual stop in there where we want to do the peer review. Once the peer review is done, it’s a simple click to continue with the build.Want to learn more about peer code review and how it guarantees a higher quality code base?

    "extractedText": "PRACTICAL AGILE\nHow Agile Estimation Techniques Help Workload Management\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n8 MAR 2021 • 2 MIN READ\nTwo questions we often hear are:\nHow do we handle a project’s workload?\nHow do we estimate how much we can get done in a sprint?\nSome agile teams refer to this as planning sprint velocity. Whatever it’s called, the goal is to decide, based on historical data, how much work a team can realistically commit to in a given week.\nTeams Who Estimate Better Manage Workloads\nLet’s start with the basics. Typically, each engineer has a 40-hour workweek. The natural assumption might be they can therefore handle 40 hours’ worth of tasks, like stories. But if the entire 40 hours are committed to tasks, it forces you to “cannibalize” the quality of the team. Why? Because inside that 40-hour workweek, the team is still going to have stand-ups, grooming and sprint planning meetings, and more.\nSince agile projects live and die by their ability to be efficient, all agile teams are committed to allocating their time to deliver the best possible product in the shortest amount of time. One powerful way to do that is with estimation, where teams consistently estimate the amount of work needed for each task.\nProject Optimization Through Agile Estimation\nAt Zibtek, we define an “efficient team” as one that’s at 60 to 70 percent. That translates into about 25 to 30 hours for development. This can understandably cause concern, particularly for clients who haven’t been through the agile development process before. They wonder what it will mean to their project. Won’t the team end up getting much less done?\nSurprisingly, the opposite is true. Employing estimation in the software development process generally means more gets done. How so? When you protect quality and have triggers built in for quality, your Devs are actually making the process smoother. There’s less rework and fewer bugs as you move through the project. And that’s important because when you don’t do these quality “pieces,” the bugs and reworks will come back to haunt you—and cause more work.\nEstimation Story Points in Agile\nIn some cases, we’ve seen not using estimation force teams to spend three to four hours fixing a feature that didn’t get enough thought and planning. So, making sure we have that buffer to keep quality high is extremely valuable as we can:\nDo architectural plannings\nThink through and hash out different scenarios\nShift left\nGet all QA people involved\nand more\nHow to Estimate Story Points\nWhen creating estimates or calculating velocity, software engineers factor in their completed work in story points over time. This helps for short-term planning and gives the team an idea of how much work is too much work.\nWe believe it’s far better to know with certainty what work will get done when we say it will get done. It’s the best way to avoid scrambling and working overtime to meet deadlines, or worse, missing a deadline altogether. Using estimation allows teams to be more realistic about the work they need to get done and builds trust with our clients. When we can confidently say, “that normally takes about a week, but we’ll give you a better estimate once we begin,” we know we’re giving our client the best and most reliable software development experience possible.To learn more about agile estimation techniques and how they help workload management, contact the team at Zibtek today with any questions you might have.

    "extractedText": "Just How Good is ChatGPT at Writing Code?\nVedant Vyas\nRead more posts by this author.\nVEDANT VYAS\n6 JUN 2023 • 4 MIN READ\nWe’ve all been there, tired after endless hours spent staring at our screens, or wrestling with lines of code while desperately seeking that \"aha\" moment. You feel like a burden to your Tech Lead and/or Senior Developer because you keep constantly asking for help and strive to be self-sufficient. You keep up with the news and you hear about ChatGPT. Can this be your light at the end of the tunnel? Yes, yes it can.\nIn an era where technology is advancing at breakneck speed, ChatGPT has emerged as a shining star, showcasing the incredible capabilities of natural language processing. Developed by OpenAI, ChatGPT has been trained on a vast corpus of text, absorbing the knowledge and patterns of language from countless sources. It can analyze prompts, understand context, and generate human-like responses. But it doesn't stop there! ChatGPT has also been exposed to a substantial amount of code, making it proficient in the language of programmers.\nWhat Languages Can ChatGPT Write In?\nFirst things first, let's talk about the programming languages that ChatGPT can write in. As a language model, ChatGPT has been trained on a vast database of text, which includes code snippets in various programming languages. This means that ChatGPT can write code in multiple programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, C++, Java, and more.\nHowever, it's worth noting that ChatGPT's coding abilities are not limited to just writing code in a particular language. ChatGPT can also perform tasks such as code completion, syntax highlighting, and error checking, which can be extremely helpful for programmers who are looking to improve their coding efficiency. We talk about this more in depth in our AI Software Development Workshop.\nHow to Write Code with ChatGPT?\nSo, how can you start writing code with ChatGPT? Well, it's pretty simple. All you need to do is provide ChatGPT with a prompt, and it will generate code for you. For example, if you're looking to write a Python program to calculate the factorial of a number, you can provide ChatGPT with a prompt such as \"Write a Python program to calculate the factorial of a number\" and it will generate the code for you.\nJust How Good is ChatGPT at Writing Code?\nIt's important to note that ChatGPT's code generation capabilities are not limited to just basic programs. It can also generate complex algorithms, machine learning models, and more. Of course, the quality of the generated code will depend on the prompt provided, so it's important to be as clear and concise as possible when providing prompts to ChatGPT.\nWhat are some ChatGPT Coding Examples?\nTo give you an idea of just how good ChatGPT is at writing code, let's take a look at some coding examples generated by ChatGPT.\nExample 1: Python program to reverse a string\nPython def reverse_string(input_string): return input_string[::-1] Example 2: JavaScript program to check if a number is prime\nJavascript function isPrime(num) { for(let i = 2; i < num; i++) if(num % i === 0) return false; return num !== 1;\n} Example 3: C++ program to sort an array in ascending order\nC++ void selectionSort(int arr[], int n) { int i, j, min_idx; for (i = 0; i < n-1; i++) { min_idx = i; for (j = i+1; j < n; j++) if (arr[j] < arr[min_idx]) min_idx = j; swap(&arr[min_idx], &arr[i]); }\n} As you can see, ChatGPT is capable of generating high-quality code that is syntactically correct and efficient.\nHow Can I Use ChatGPT To Help With Coding?\nNow that you've seen some examples of ChatGPT's coding capabilities, you might be wondering how you can use it to help with your own coding projects. Here are some ways in which ChatGPT can be useful:\nCode completion: If you're stuck on a particular piece of code, you can use ChatGPT to generate suggestions for how to complete it.\nCode review: You can use ChatGPT to review your code and identify any errors or inefficiencies.\nAlgorithm generation: If you're struggling to come up with an algorithm for a particular problem, ChatGPT can generate algorithmic solutions based on your problem statement.\nCode documentation: ChatGPT can help you generate documentation for your code, saving you time and effort.\nJust How Good is ChatGPT at Writing Code?\nWill ChatGPT Ever Replace Coders?\nNow, let's address the elephant in the room: will ChatGPT ever replace coders? Well, while ChatGPT is undoubtedly a powerful tool for coding assistance, it's unlikely to replace human coders entirely.\nCoding is not just about writing syntactically correct code; it's about problem-solving, creativity, and critical thinking. ChatGPT may be able to generate code based on prompts, but it lacks the contextual understanding and creativity that human coders bring to the table. Think of it more as a great tool in your toolbox rather than a crutch you can lean on.\nFurthermore, coding is a constantly evolving field. New programming languages, frameworks, and technologies emerge all the time. While ChatGPT can adapt to some of these changes, it may struggle with more complex and specialized domains.\nIn conclusion, ChatGPT is a fantastic tool that can significantly enhance your coding experience. It can write code in various languages, provide code completion, and assist with code review. However, human coders will continue to play a crucial role in software development, bringing their problem-solving skills, creativity, and adaptability to the table.\nSo, embrace ChatGPT as your coding buddy, but don't forget to nurture your own coding skills and continue to learn and grow as a programmer.

For most people, it’s like trying to herd cats while riding a unicycle—blindfolded. As custom software developers, though, we know just how critical it is to create a budget for software projects. Not only does it help keep costs under control, but it also provides transparency and accountability throughout the project’s lifecycle. Lastly, it fosters better communication between stakeholders, allowing everyone to align project activities with financial objectives and priorities.\nWhy does nearly everyone dread budgeting so much? Experts say it boils down to five gripes:\n1. It takes too long.\n2. There are too many iterations, so it rapidly becomes outdated.\n3. An overwhelming number of people are involved.\n4. There’s too much “game-playing”.\n5. It doesn’t help run the business.\nIn truth, budgets have been around for over a century, and most businesses wouldn’t dream of giving them up. However, creating a precise software project budget is, to put it mildly, challenging—especially considering the pace at which software changes. It's always best, then, to have a developer provide a ballpark estimate. Because while an experienced development company can approximate your cost, you’ll likely need to re-evaluate the budget frequently and often.\nHow to Create a Budget for a Custom Software Project: A Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is Typically Included in a Software Project Budget?\nLearning to love, or at least appreciate, budgeting is a key ingredient for successful project execution. It helps the entire team identify and understand significant weaknesses, speeds decision-making, and keeps all stakeholders focused on a successful outcome.\nThe budget for an agile project must consider the combined costs of all activities, tasks, and milestones the project must fulfill throughout its many changes. And while you don’t want to make frequent changes just because you can, it’s nice to know you have the luxury of pivoting when the situation calls for it.\nAgile development is done in sprints. It’s no surprise, then, that agile budgets are designed to align with each sprint.\nA standard agile budget includes:\nBallpark estimations based on project requirements. These rough approximations are based on information the client or product owner provides about the software, its intended users, and what issues it’s meant to solve.\nPersonnel costs and third-party services, including internal and external engineers, testers, managers, and support staff.\nHardware and infrastructure required for development, testing, and deployment.\nTesting and quality assurance, including external testing services.\nA buffer amount or contingency for unexpected changes, costs, and events.\nMaintenance and support such as bug fixes, software updates, and ongoing tech support.\nWhat Do I Need to Consider When Budgeting for Custom Software Development?\nBy now, you should feel a little better about diving into the budget pool. Once you’re clear on your requirements, have planned for potential risks, and made a careful estimation, creating a budget that supports your project is much easier. As you do, take into account these key factors.\n1. Project scope. Identify and document your project’s goals, deliverables, features, functions, tasks, deadlines, and costs. The more detailed and precise the plan, the more accurate your costs will be, and the more likely you’ll avoid “scope creep” that often impacts budgets and timelines.\n2. Resource allocation. Will you use in-house resources and external talent? Allow for associated costs such as salaries, benefits, and outsourcing fees.\n3. Development approach. Different methodologies come with different cost implications. Zibtek’s practical agile approach improves overall project efficiency, making it a cost-effective method.\n4. Technical complexity. Projects requiring more specialized expertise, integration with existing systems, or extensive testing typically come with higher costs.\n5. Third-party services. Factor in cloud hosting, payment gateways, and other integrated third-party services, as well as any licensing fees or subscription costs.\n6. Maintenance and support. Continuous maintenance and support include everything from updates and upgrades to integration and performance optimization. These ongoing activities are critical to your software’s longevity and usability.\n7. Outsource partner. If you choose to work with a third-party software development company, carefully evaluate their pricing models and weigh whether their expertise, reputation, and cost align with your project’s requirements and budgetary considerations.\nHow to Create a Budget for a Custom Software Project: A Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat Steps Do I Need to Take to Create a Custom Software Budget?\nWe won’t go so far as to say creating a custom software budget can be fun, but it doesn’t have to be torturous, either. As you navigate the twists and turns of financial constraints, you’ll soon learn to uncover the most efficient and cost-effective solutions. And along the way, you’ll learn more about your project intricacies, weigh multiple costs and benefits, and ultimately forge a path that meets your needs.\nReady to do a little work? These four simple steps will have you creating a custom software budget with confidence and clarity.\nStep 1: Define Tasks and Milestones\nDevelopment, testing, and maintenance are agile’s major phases. Each should be broken down into smaller stages representing each feature to be completed during development. Once you know the project’s scope, you need to evaluate which resources you need, including personnel, technologies, and infrastructure.\nStep 2: Request Software Budget Estimates\nEach item now needs a realistic estimation. The fastest and most dependable way to get this information is to consult with qualified software developers. Their extensive experience tends to surpass that of internal teams, as they’ve worked with various industries and in multiple languages. In most cases, they can draw on this expertise to deliver valuable insight into the time, effort, and cost involved, ensuring your budget’s based on accurate and up-to-date information.\nStep 3: Compare Custom Software Development Estimates\nScope alignment, cost breakdown, delivery timeline, and resource allocation are a few of the factors that can help you make an informed decision. You also want to look at case studies and references and ask about additional services and support like post-development maintenance.\nStep 4: Finalize Your Budget\nHaving done your research, you know your priorities and how those priorities impact the cost of your software project. You can now confidently make informed decisions and allocate the necessary funds to each aspect of your project.\nHow Much Does Custom Software Development Cost?\nFactors affecting custom software development costs range from project complexity and scope, to team size and skillsets. The tech stack you choose can also affect the bottom line, as can software and tools licensing fees. Quality assurance is also a crucial aspect of software development and can impact costs, particularly on projects calling for more resources and time.\nCustom software maintenance costs vary depending on the system’s complexity, update and bug fix frequency, and the level of support required from the development team.\nNo matter your project’s scope, Zibtek works with you to establish a responsible budget that incorporates a comprehensive plan. Before you know it, you’ll be herding cats like a seasoned feline whisperer, guiding your project toward a successful—and cost-effective—launch. To learn more, reach out to us today.

It’s a somewhat crazy investment but also an excellent illustration of how deeply people today value personalization and uniqueness.\nWith so much value placed on rising above the crowd, why would any business settle for generic software that lacks crucial functionalities and hinders business growth? Custom software solutions ensure every aspect of your operations, from workflows to reporting and analytics, is precisely designed to meet your unique needs, driving success and competitive advantage.\nWhy Go Custom?\nConvenience and cost-effectiveness are often cited as top reasons to go custom in software development. But these and other practical benefits, like easy integration, ongoing tech support, and scalability, only tell part of the story.\nCustom software solutions are also one of the best ways to grow your business and stay in front of your competitors.\nHow Custom Software Solutions Can Help Your Business\nImagine two vacation tour companies. One offers generic outings, believing a one-size-fits-all itinerary will appeal to the broadest audience. They have predetermined schedules, take people to all the “popular” attractions and restaurants, and lack flexibility. Now consider the custom tour company that lets people design their dream vacations and itineraries, recognizing that personalized experiences ensure a truly immersive and unforgettable experience.\nWhile a generic tour can certainly be preferable to not traveling at all, custom tour providers typically have the potential for higher profitability. It’s true the customization they offer often comes at a premium price, but it also differentiates them and attracts customers willing to pay that premium.\nCustom software development offers similar benefits, providing tailored solutions that foster innovation, secure a sustainable growth trajectory, and define your business as a leader in its field.\nIncrease Efficiency and Performance with Custom Software\nOf course, we’re not in any way anti-practical. In fact, we bill our process as “a practical agile approach”!\nSo, let’s look at two reasons why custom software solutions are worth it for businesses internally and with customers: efficiency and scalability.\nImproved efficiency. By tailoring software to specific business needs and processes, you can automate repetitive tasks and eliminate unnecessary steps. The result? Reduced boredom that often arises from mundane and monotonous work. When you release your teams from tedious tasks, they’re able to redirect their energy and brainpower toward more engaging and intellectually stimulating activities. This not only improves job satisfaction but also enhances creativity and innovation.\nEasy scalability. Custom software is specifically designed to accommodate growth and changing business needs. As your business flourishes, you can easily scale up, adding new features and functionalities to support increased demands. This flexibility ensures your software remains aligned with your company’s evolution and enables it to adapt and perform optimally in dynamic environments.\nStreamline Workflow with Custom Solutions\nCustom software also allows for the integration of various systems and applications, which in turn, facilitates smooth data flow and collaboration across teams and departments. Customized user interfaces and intuitive functionalities allow team members to effortlessly navigate the software, saving time and reducing errors. Workflows become more efficient with tasks seamlessly transitioning from one stage to the next, and people focusing on value-added activities rather than administrative or monotonous tasks.\nHow Custom Software Solutions Can Help Your Business\nIt’s Worth the Extra Effort\nAre you game for one more analogy? Here we go.\nWhile most of us don’t expect to accept an Oscar or win a Nobel Prize, if we did, we’d for sure want a custom suit or dress that makes a lasting impression and shows we value excellence and uniqueness.\nJust like that fashion masterpiece, custom software offers:\nA precise fit. Custom software is built specifically for your business. It emphasizes your assets and aligns perfectly with your overall operation.\nAttention to detail. Bespoke designers pay meticulous attention to every detail, from fabric selection to stitching and finishing touches. Likewise, custom software developers delve into your business’s individual requirements, considering factors like functionality, user experience, and security to ensure every aspect of your software solution is tailored to perfection.\nExclusivity. Custom clothing is generally associated with high-quality artistry and singularity.

    "extractedText": "CUSTOM SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT\nWhich Software Development Methodologies Work Best in 2025?\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n11 AUG 2025 • 5 MIN READ\nTable of Contents\nWhy Choosing the Right Software Development Method Matters\nTraditional Software Process Methodologies: Are They Still Relevant?\nAgile, Scrum & Beyond — Modern Development Methodologies\nDevOps, CI/CD & Lean: The New-Age Software Development Approaches\nEmerging Methodologies in Software Development (2025 and Beyond)\nChoosing the Right Development Model for Your Software Project\nHow Zibtek Helps You Navigate Software Development Methodologies\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nWhen software projects fail, it's often not due to poor coding—but poor planning. One of the most overlooked causes? Choosing the wrong software development methodology. In 2025, the landscape of development is more complex than ever. Teams are hybrid, customers expect faster delivery, and technologies like AI and automation are rapidly reshaping workflows.\nAt Zibtek, we understand that one size doesn’t fit all. We don’t just write code—we choose the right development methodologies based on your business goals, technical constraints, and market urgency. In this blog, we’ll explore the most effective software development methodologies today—from traditional to cutting-edge. Whether you're a startup or an enterprise, this guide will help you align your software project with the right development model.\nWhy Choosing the Right Software Development Method Matters\nA well-executed software development method can drastically reduce time-to-market, prevent scope creep, and ensure high-quality deliverables. In contrast, a poor match between project type and methodology can lead to inconsistent sprints, redundant iterations, and bloated budgets.\nZibtek applies technical due diligence in selecting the ideal software development methods. We assess complexity, scalability, compliance needs, and integration requirements to tailor an approach that ensures predictability and transparency across the project lifecycle.\nTraditional Software Process Methodologies: Are They Still Relevant?\nClassic software process methodologies like Waterfall, V-Model, and Spiral are not obsolete—they're just specialized.\nZibtek leverages these methodologies when working on complex legacy modernizations or hardware-integrated applications where predictability and documentation are paramount.\nAgile, Scrum & Beyond Modern Development Methodologies\nAgile has become the cornerstone of modern development methodologies, particularly for teams operating in fast-changing environments. Its core strengths lie in iterative development, continuous stakeholder collaboration, and the ability to adapt to changing requirements without derailing timelines.\nAmong Agile frameworks, Scrum and Kanban are the most widely adopted. Scrum runs on fixed-length sprints (2–4 weeks) with defined roles—Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Development Team. It uses sprint planning, daily standups, and end-of-sprint reviews to ensure focus, accountability, and continuous improvement.\nKanban is flow-based, visualizing tasks on a board from “To Do” to “Done.” By limiting work in progress (WIP) and tracking metrics like cycle time, it reduces bottlenecks and optimizes delivery speed for ongoing, flexible projects.\nAt Zibtek, we implement hybrid Agile models tailored to the client’s domain and delivery expectations. For startups, we recommend lightweight, 2-week sprints with continuous feedback loops and rapid iterations. For enterprise clients, our Agile delivery is enhanced with milestone-based reporting and compliance documentation—ensuring both speed and structure. This dual approach balances agility with traceability, helping teams scale effectively.\nDevOps, CI/CD & Lean: The New Age Software Development Approaches\nBeyond Agile, companies are adopting software development approaches that integrate operations, automation, and continuous delivery.\nDevOps bridges the gap between development and IT operations. It includes practices like Infrastructure as Code (IaC), automated testing, and continuous monitoring.\nCI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment): Developers merge code frequently, triggering automated builds and deployments.\nLean Development minimizes waste and maximizes learning through validated experimentation and small batch releases.\nZibtek is a strong proponent of these software development approaches, helping clients build resilient, scalable systems with rapid feedback loops. We implement CI/CD pipelines using tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and Azure DevOps to ship faster with confidence.\nEmerging Methodologies in Software Development (2025 and Beyond)\nThe future is not just iterative—it's intelligent and adaptive. Some of the most innovative methodologies in software development today include:\nAI-assisted development: Tools like GitHub Copilot and custom LLMs streamline code generation and refactoring.\nPlatform Engineering: Standardizes environments and toolchains, empowering developers through self-service infrastructure.\nLow-code/No-code with pro oversight: Speeds up MVP creation, while custom development ensures security and scalability.\nHybrid remote methodologies: Using async-first collaboration strategies and DevSecOps practices to unify distributed teams.\nAt Zibtek, we help clients capitalize on these trends without sacrificing control or quality. We blend emerging tools with best practices to future-proof your software project.\nChoosing the Right Development Model for Your Software Project\nThere is no universal best development model—only one that best fits your software project.\nFor fixed-budget, compliance-heavy applications → Waterfall or V-Model\nFor evolving products in competitive markets → Agile or Lean\nFor scalable SaaS platforms → Agile + DevOps + CI/CD\nFor innovation prototypes → Low-code with developer supervision\nZibtek's consultative approach evaluates your business model, team capability, timeline, and risk profile. We then recommend a tailored blend of software development methodologies that maximizes your ROI and minimizes delivery risk.\nHow Zibtek Helps You Navigate Software Development Methodologies\nZibtek’s approach to software development methodologies isn’t dogmatic—it’s strategic. We combine US-based strategy and management with global engineering talent to deliver smart, scalable solutions.\nWhether your team prefers Agile, requires documentation-heavy process models, or needs to integrate AI into the workflow, we adapt and implement the ideal methodology for your goals. Our clients benefit from:\nDedicated project managers – Act as your point of contact at Zibtek, ensuring smooth collaboration, quick responses, and proactive problem-solving throughout the project.\nTransparent reporting and KPIs – We give you access to real-time progress dashboards and measurable metrics so you’re never in the dark about your project’s progress.\nCI/CD-enabled infrastructure – Zibtek’s automated pipelines speed up releases, minimize deployment risks, and keep your application running reliably at all times.\nContinuous stakeholder alignment – Our team regularly syncs with your stakeholders to ensure evolving goals, technical needs, and product vision stay perfectly aligned.\nChoosing Zibtek means choosing a partner who not only understands software development methodologies but applies them pragmatically to ensure project success.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n1. What are the top software development methodologies in 2025? The leading methodologies in 2025 include Agile, DevOps, CI/CD, and Lean development. Emerging approaches like platform engineering and AI-driven development are also gaining traction.\n2. Which development model is best for startups? Agile or hybrid Agile models are ideal for startups due to their flexibility and rapid iteration cycles. They enable continuous feedback and quick pivots based on market response.\n3. How do I choose between Agile and Waterfall? Choose Agile if your project requires flexibility, frequent releases, and user feedback. Waterfall works better when requirements are fixed and need formal approvals or compliance.\n4. Is DevOps a software development methodology? DevOps is more than a methodology—it’s a culture and set of practices that combine development and operations. It complements Agile by accelerating deployment and improving collaboration across teams. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

    "extractedText": "Swarming: How to Speed Up Your Software Development\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n13 APR 2021 • 3 MIN READ\nSwarming is an effective way to speed up software development. While typically the custom software development process is a delicate balancing act between quality and efficiency, sometimes urgent needs require the process to be sped up. While we believe quality should never suffer at the expense of expediency, many of our clients have urgent, immediate software needs that dictate getting things done fast. Since the primary goal of agile software development is to deliver working software fast and frequently, a technique called “swarming” is used to complete the work more efficiently.\nSwarming in Practice\nSwarming is simply embracing the idea that more gets done when more people work on a problem. It’s a practical approach to teamwork that is slowly making its way into every aspect of an organization’s operations.\nFrom sports to birds and bees, the concept of swarming has always been used to achieve a common goal. Look, for example, at the Amish barn-raising tradition. If every farmer decided to build their barn independently or with one or two friends, it would take weeks to months to complete. On the other hand, a well-organized barn-raising brings the entire community together, and by nightfall, the barn is entirely built. Along with safe shelter for livestock, the collaborative process has always allowed communities to grow more quickly and prosper.\nIn software development, swarming works the same way. A couple of months ago, we published a post where we talked about the Pareto, or 80/20 principle, as it applied to getting software features working as quickly as possible. The same idea applies here: it’s better to have 80% of a product’s features 100% done than to have 100% of the features 80% completed. The aim is to get more stories fully completed.\nSwarming, then, is simply the act of the whole development team coming together to solve a problem or get something done quickly. More importantly, the team is focusing on getting work done that is valued by the business.\nAgile Swarming - Instant Productivity Boost\nWe’ve talked before about how user stories are a terrific tool for keeping teams focused on the end-user. Most technologists, though, prefer to avoid putting too many people on any given topic. They believe it makes the process more tricky and complicated, with everyone stepping on everyone else’s toes. But while too many cooks in the kitchen might indeed spoil the soup, in a practical agile process, things are made better, not worse, by getting everyone involved.\nWith agile swarming, you're using a swarm mentality with user stories and you identify the highest priority unit of work and put as many people as you can on that topic to get it done fast. Instead of having one or two developers working on multiple separate stories, swarming brings all the developers to work (swarm) on a single story.\nTo get the most out of swarming, teams must:\nEnsure they agree on what the top priority item in their backlog is.\nPull in anyone and everyone conceivably available and able to add value by working on that priority item.\nGet to work quickly in a truly simultaneous way on that item.\nOnce one priority item is 100% complete, the team can then swarm onto the next item until it’s completed, and so on.\nSwarming can seem counterintuitive. After all, wouldn’t more work get done if everyone were working on different items at the same time? Yet, swarming has proven to increase a team’s velocity while avoiding the bottleneck that so frequently occurs at the end of a sprint, where everything must be tested at once. It also improves what’s known as process efficiency, or having the lowest amount of waste, aka any activity that doesn’t add value to the product, in the development process.\nSwarming - Speed Up Your Software Development Process\nSwarming is a true secret weapon in the agile development process and in more ways than we’ve talked about above. Swarming also helps individual team members learn from other more experienced devs and improve their skill sets. This isn’t the primary focus of swarming, of course. Still, it’s a nice benefit that helps our clients get the highest level of expertise available.\nMany companies come to us wanting to “swarm.” They might not know that’s the word for what they’re looking for, but the bottom line is they want their software development problems solved really quickly. And if putting ten or more devs on a topic gets them the super speedy solution they’re after, it’s often worth the extra financial investment involved.\nIf you have an urgent software development project that you need completed sooner rather than later, swarming may be just the ticket to speeding up the process without compromising the product quality.

    "extractedText": "SOFTWARE OUTSOURCING\nHow Much Does it Cost to Outsource Software Development?\nUnderstand what budgeting factors to consider when outsourcing software development and what to expect from the process.\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n13 MAR 2023 • 6 MIN READ\n“How much is this going to cost us?” It’s a question we hear time and again, and the answer is seldom what the client was hoping for. Two quick answers come to mind, one slightly more diplomatic than the other:\n1. “That depends.”\n2. “How much will it cost you to do nothing?”\nOutsourced software development is one of the best ways to reduce software development costs. Still, that reality is of little comfort to SMBs who are new to the process or new to working with a software development company that actually delivers.\nIf you’re considering outsourcing software engineering for your app and want to avoid sticker shock when crossing the finish line, it helps to understand what drives the cost of expert software development. So, in the interest of transparency—and to reduce uncertainty—we’re giving you the big picture of what goes into outsourced software development and why it can be one of your wisest investments.\nWhat is Outsourcing Software Development?\nApproximately 65% of businesses now outsource at least some of their software development, and experts project the market will reach $98 billion by 2024.\nSoftware development outsourcing is precisely what it sounds like: you hire a third-party company to develop your website or applications. Development services can include everything from in-house custom software to commercial solutions for your customers or clients. No matter what the project, outsourcing allows your internal IT team to focus on other growth and innovation-related initiatives.\nSome of the most popular services you can outsource are:\n1. UI/ UX design\n2. Web development\n3. Mobile development\n4. Corporate solutions\n5. eCommerce\n6. Consulting and feasibility studies\nOutsourcing Software Development\nWhile some companies can conceivably do the work in-house, it requires skilled developers and sometimes sizable investment in other resources, including research and development and opportunity and maintenance costs.\nOutsourced software development lets you build sites and apps more quickly and for less money. In fact, a Deloitte survey found that nearly 40% of companies who outsource report savings as high as 40 percent; the other 60 percent report ten to 25 percent savings.\nWhy Outsource Software Development?\nTo paraphrase a popular adage: good software development might be expensive, but bad software development will cost you a fortune.\nDo a quick search, and it’s plain to see there’s no shortage of “experts” ready and willing to help you build the next big piece of software. Unfortunately, many of them aren’t able to come through. The simple truth is quality comes at a cost.\nTo illustrate:\nLet’s say you get two bids for a piece of marketing automation software you want to develop that gets you more leads. Both proposals share the same essential function, and both are user-friendly, but they have some key differences:\n· One has neatly organized code and costs $15,000.\n· The other’s coding is a tangled mess but it only costs $1,500.\nSome people might immediately jump on the $1,500 app as customers don’t know the difference between organized and unorganized code. And, anyway, a code’s tidiness doesn’t mean much when it comes to what a user experiences.\nWhy would anyone, you might ask, pay an extra just for orderly code? To our thinking, that’s like asking why anyone would buy a cheap mattress that causes chronic back pain over a quality one that improves their daily quality of life. Good mattresses cost more because they’re filled with high-performance materials. And any developer worth their salt will tell you that internal quality makes it easier to enhance software when you decide to update or add new features.\nAnd that’s just the start. From a financial standpoint, outsourcing also helps you:\nAvoid the costs associated with recruiting, onboarding, and training additional staff.\n2. Take advantage of up-to-the-minute resources you might not otherwise have access to.\n3. Work with developers with the professional expertise and latest tech skills that lead to faster results.\nSo, technically speaking, outsourcing software development is an investment. However, it helps to view it as a capital expenditure rather than an operational one. Why’s that? Because you only work with an outsourced development team for a short period, and when they finish the project, they move on. You launch your product and begin to see the benefits more quickly than you would if you built the software in-house. Not a bad return on that “investment.”\nHow Much Does It Cost to Outsource Software Development?\n“But seriously, how much will it cost us?”\nThis is where our “it depends” answer applies. For instance, multiple outsourcing models exist, including project-based, dedicated teams, team augmentation, time and material, and fixed-price.\nWe’ve already talked about how good a long-term investment outsourcing software developers can be. But it’s the short-term impact most customers think about, and that can make it challenging to see the lasting benefits.\nAnother consideration is just how different every project can be, making it difficult or nearly impossible to create a pricing template. If you’ve done any research, you’ve probably seen hourly engineer costs ranging from $30 to $150 or more per hour and estimated software costs of $20,000 to $150,000 and higher. Not particularly helpful, right?\nA “backward” approach to cost analysis can help you keep costs lower without sacrificing quality.\n1. Deadlines\nScheduling plays a massive role in estimating software costs. Do you want to launch your software as quickly as possible? Your outsource partner might need to flesh out resources to accommodate your deadline. On the other hand, the more flexible you can be on delivery, the more you might save. Asking your developer for a realistic timeframe that includes non-development tasks can give you a rough idea of your total cost.\n2. Developer Skills\nWhat you pay a software development team is highly dependent on the project’s complexity and the skills your team brings to the undertaking. If you’re tempted to put together a smaller team to save money, consider that you might ultimately end up paying more, as the project will take longer to complete.\n3. Project Scope\nEvery deliverable, added feature, and extra round of testing adds to your project’s bottom line. Using wireframes to fully flesh out the project’s scope beforehand can keep your cost estimate as precise as possible.\n4. Creative Design\nApple’s App Store has 2.184 million games and apps, and the number grows every day; Google Play has 2.7 million. Skilled UI/UX designers ensure your product is visually appealing, easy to navigate, and one people will use and recommend.\n5. Third-Party Integrations\nERPs and CRMs offer various user and business opportunities, but they can add time to the project and affect development costs. On the flip side, they can integrate ready-made solutions into your software, saving time and money.\n6. Methodology\nThere are at least ten types of software development and which one you choose directly impacts the project’s final price tag. We use an agile approach because it allows for evolution as the project progresses.\nOutsourced Software Development\nPros and Cons of Outsourcing Software Development\nLet’s recap.\nReasons to invest in outsourcing include:\n· At will and rapid scaling up or down.\n· Improved cash flow.\n· Cost savings.\n· Increased efficiency.\n· Wider talent pool.\nWe don’t pretend there’s one ideal solution to software development, so here are a few shortcomings to consider:\n· Potential communication issues.\n· Differing business philosophies.\n· Higher security risks.\n· Less control over the process.\nWe’re fortunate to have a strong US team to help mitigate security concerns and communications challenges. And our practical agile process prioritizes transparency and includes assessing whether our company and yours are a good cultural fit.\nOur advice? Weigh the pros and cons of outsourcing carefully before diving into the search for a reliable provider.\nBenefits of Outsourcing Software Development\nWe’ve now arrived at our “how much will it cost you to do nothing?” response.\nOutsourcing software development can also be key to future-proofing your business.\nEmbedding resilience. Businesses that outsource at least part of their software development are better equipped to absorb economic shocks.\nProactive risk management. Outsourcing can help you assess potential pitfalls like unrealistic expectations, inefficient processes, and inadequate quality assurance.\nThe right outsource partner can integrate into your existing team with minimal disruption while providing the highest level of tech performance.

However, if you embrace Salk’s philosophy, true discovery comes in finding the right questions to ask.\nBy asking the “right” questions, stakeholders, owners, project managers, and developers can:\nName the most critical underlying issues.\nDesign an effective solution more quickly.\nA software development company that uses an approach grounded in exploring the problem at hand can better understand the software's functionality and purpose. Simply asking the right questions drives a more effective and efficient software development process.\nIf you’re preparing to outsource software development, you probably have a million questions. We want to help you get that number down to something more manageable. Because when you narrow your questions down to the ones that get to the heart of the problem, you’re better equipped to find the right outsourcing partner and achieve your goals.\nWhat Information is Needed Before Starting a Software Development Project?\nSoftware development is a complex, ever-evolving field that many people find intimidating. It’s not uncommon for stakeholders who feel this way to shell out often inordinate sums of money to third parties just so they don’t have to deal with a process they don’t understand.\nWe’re not huge fans of the let’s-just-throw-a-bunch-of-money-at-a-project-and-hope-for-the-best approach. Our agile software development process relies on all stakeholders taking part in planning, researching, and developing web and mobile apps. First, close collaboration guarantees everyone’s needs and expectations are met on an ongoing basis. Second, it ensures the end product is of the highest quality.\nStarting a Software Development Project? Ask These Questions\nWe always suggest that our clients start the software development process by conducting an internal assessment that covers:\nThe product’s goals and scope, including the problem it aims to solve.\nEnd-user needs and requirements.\nWhat technical requirements, such as programming language, platform, and software architecture there are.\nA realistic budget and timeline.\nPutting together a project team.\nOf course, if there are topics you need more clarity on, like a programming language, the outsource development companies you’re vetting should be able to give you a sound and easy-to-understand description of your options.\nWhen it comes to choosing an outsource partner, you ultimately won’t go wrong if you select one who can check off “yes” to these three criteria:\n1. Their portfolio illustrates their value proposition.\n2. They build the type of software you’re looking for.\n3. They have a reputation for thought leadership in the industry.\nOne final bit of pre-planning advice. Don’t hold back on what you expect from your outsource development partner. Ask potential partners what types of projects they are and aren’t a good fit for. If they respond by saying, “We’re good at all types of projects!” consider taking them out of contention. A trustworthy software development company is always willing to say when they don’t think they’re suitable for the job.\nWhat Are The First Steps in the Software Development Process?\nZibtek takes a practical agile approach to software development that’s based on four core values:\n1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.\n2. Functioning software over extensive documentation.\n3. Client collaboration over contract negotiation.\n4. Responding to change over rigid plan adherence.\nThis iterative approach to software development designs, develops, and tests code in repeated cycles and uses small, manageable tasks called user stories. We then prioritize, estimate, and assign the stories to “sprints,” or time-bound development cycles that, depending on a project’s scope, are usually one to four weeks long.\nDuring sprints, the development team tests and delivers working software increments for stakeholders to review and assess. Any feedback is then used to refine the product and plan for the next sprint.\nWhat Questions Should I Ask My Software Development Company?\nNow let’s circle back to our opening thoughts and talk about which questions will help you choose a development partner who can deliver the software product you envision.\n1. What experience does your company have developing software solutions? Do you have case studies I can look at?\n2. Can you walk me through your development process in a way I can understand?\n3. How do you ensure the final product meets my business’s needs and goals?\n4. How do you handle changes in project scope and requirements?\n5. What is your communication process during development?\n6. How do you ensure software and user data security and privacy?\nTaken as a whole, these six questions help you quickly learn about a company's expertise, approach, and commitment to delivering software solutions that meet your vision and requirements. They also ensure a transparent line of communication so you stay informed and involved throughout the development process.\nStarting a Software Development Project? Ask These Questions\nWe Have a “Soft Spot” for Questions!\nWe love famous-people quotes because they often get our point across much more succinctly than we do. So we’ll close this piece with another favorite, this time from American philosopher John Dewey. Renowned for his pragmatic theory of inquiry, Dewey believed that “A problem well put is half-solved.”\nIn other words, when there’s a clear and concise understanding of a problem, you’re halfway toward finding a solution. As your software development partner, we work with you to clearly define the problem you hope to solve, as that makes it easier for our team to develop software that achieves your goals.\nOf course, no one’s trying to pretend that budget questions aren’t a priority in software development, but they’re rarely the best way to find an outsource partner you can trust to deliver what you’re looking for. Fortunately, queries related to goals, timelines, and quality requirements typically help you avoid unnecessary costs due to over-engineering or developing non-required features. Voila! Budget concerns resolved.\nTo learn more about our software development process and how we can best put it to work for your next project, reach out to us today.\nSOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT MODEL\n7 Important Software Development Models\nAnyone who’s watched a few episodes of Silicon Valley knows a little bit about software development:\nSOFTWARE DEPLOYMENT PROCESS\nEverything You Need to Know About the Software Deployment Process\nThe software deployment process is one of the most crucial parts of any development project.

This requires a workforce that is agile, flexible, and collaborative. An agile workforce is one that can move and adjust easily to change, as often as necessary, without compromising productivity, engagement, or customer satisfaction. An agile workforce is also one that can leverage the skills and talents of both permanent employees and contingent workers, such as freelancers, contractors, or consultants, to create a diverse and scalable talent pool that can meet the varying needs of different projects and situations.\nHow can businesses harness strategic staff augmentation for workforce enhancement?\nOne of the ways that businesses can create an agile workforce is by using strategic staff augmentation. This is a workforce strategy that involves hiring external workers on a temporary or project-based basis to supplement the existing staff and fill in the skill gaps or capacity shortages. Strategic staff augmentation can help businesses enhance their workforce in several ways:\n- It can provide access to specialized skills and expertise that may not be available in-house or in the local market.\n- It can offer flexibility and scalability to adjust the workforce size and composition according to the changing project requirements and business goals.\n- It can reduce the costs and risks associated with hiring, training, and retaining permanent employees, especially for short-term or uncertain projects.\n- It can improve the quality and speed of project delivery by bringing in fresh perspectives, innovative ideas, and best practices from external experts.\n- It can foster a culture of collaboration, learning, and innovation by exposing the internal staff to diverse backgrounds, experiences, and knowledge.\nAgile Workforce, Agile Business: Unleashing the Power of Staff Augmentation\nWhy is agility crucial in adapting to dynamic project needs with staff augmentation?\nAgility is crucial in adapting to dynamic project needs with staff augmentation because it enables businesses to respond effectively and efficiently to the opportunities and challenges that arise in the market. By using staff augmentation, businesses can:\n- Quickly assemble a team of qualified and experienced workers who can deliver high-quality results within the desired timeframe and budget.\n- Easily scale up or down the team size as the project scope, complexity, or duration changes.\n- Seamlessly integrate the external workers with the internal staff and processes, ensuring smooth communication, coordination, and collaboration.\n- Continuously monitor and evaluate the project performance and feedback, making adjustments and improvements as needed.\nWhat sets apart a reliable staff augmentation partner in the context of business flexibility?\nA reliable staff augmentation partner is one that can provide businesses with the right talent at the right time for the right project. A reliable staff augmentation partner should have:\n- A large network of vetted and verified workers who have the relevant skills, experience, and credentials for various projects and industries.\n- A robust screening and matching process that can identify and select the best-fit workers for each project based on the specific requirements and preferences of the business.\n- A comprehensive support system that can handle the administrative, legal, and logistical aspects of hiring, managing, and paying the external workers.\n- A proactive approach that can anticipate and address any issues or challenges that may arise during the project lifecycle.\nWhy is strategic staff augmentation considered a cost-effective solution for businesses?\nStrategic staff augmentation is considered a cost-effective solution for businesses because it can help them save money on several fronts:\n- It can eliminate or reduce the expenses associated with recruiting, training, and retaining permanent employees, such as advertising fees, payroll taxes, benefits packages, severance payments, etc.\n- It can avoid or minimize the costs associated with underutilized or idle staff during periods of low demand or activity.\n- It can lower or prevent the costs associated with project delays or failures due to skill shortages or capacity constraints.\n- It can increase or optimize the return on investment (ROI) by ensuring that each project is completed on time, on budget, and on quality.\nAgile Workforce, Agile Business: Unleashing the Power of Staff Augmentation\nWhy should businesses choose Zibtek for their strategic staff augmentation needs?\nBusinesses should choose Zibtek for their strategic staff augmentation needs because Zibtek is a leading provider of IT staffing solutions that can help businesses achieve their agile business goals. Zibtek offers:\n- Access to a global pool of over 250 highly skilled and experienced software developers who can work on any technology stack or platform.\n- Flexibility to hire developers on a full-time, part-time, or hourly basis depending on the project needs and budget.\n- Quality assurance to ensure that each developer meets the highest standards of professionalism, performance, and communication.\n- Transparency to provide regular updates and reports on the project progress and status.\n- Security to protect the intellectual property rights and confidential information of each client.\nTo illustrate these points further, let's use a creative analogy throughout this blog post. Imagine that your business is like a car. You want your car to be fast, efficient, and reliable. You want it to be able to navigate different terrains, weather conditions, and traffic situations. You want it to be able to perform well in any scenario. To achieve this, you need a car that is agile. You need a car that can adapt to the changing road conditions and driver preferences. You need a car that can switch gears, modes, and features as needed. You need a car that can leverage the power and potential of both the internal and external components.\nThis is where strategic staff augmentation comes in. Strategic staff augmentation is like adding or replacing parts of your car with external ones that can enhance its performance and functionality. For example, you can add a turbocharger to boost your engine power, or you can replace your tires with all-season ones to improve your traction and stability. By using strategic staff augmentation, you can:\n- Access specialized parts that may not be available or compatible with your car model or make.\n- Adjust the parts according to the road conditions and driver preferences.\n- Integrate the parts with your existing car system and controls.\n- Monitor and evaluate the parts' performance and feedback.\n- Save money on buying, maintaining, and storing the parts.\nZibtek is like a trusted mechanic who can help you with your strategic staff augmentation needs. Zibtek can:\n- Provide you with a wide range of high-quality parts that can work on any car type or model.\n- Help you choose the best parts for your car based on your specific needs and preferences.\n- Handle the installation, maintenance, and payment of the parts.\n- Anticipate and resolve any issues or challenges that may arise with the parts.\n- Ensure that your car runs smoothly, efficiently, and reliably.\nSo, if you want to unleash the power of staff augmentation for your agile business, contact Zibtek today and let us help you transform your car into a supercar!\nUnlock Business Agility with Staff Augmentation Brilliance!\"\nCurious about how staff augmentation can be customized to suit your business needs?

    "extractedText": "SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS\nThe Client’s Guide to Successful Communication with Software Developers\nCommunication with software developers can be a challenge from breaking language barriers to utilizing key tools. Learn effective techniques for corresponding.\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n7 MAR 2023 • 7 MIN READ\nTwo-way communication fosters team building and strengthens collaboration. But what happens when the communication between you and your software development team becomes a one-way street?\nClose-knit agile software development teams know just how critical good communication is in the development process. And not just between each other—it also extends to clients and other external stakeholders. When that communication fails, as it so often does, everyone wastes precious time and energy doing things that aren’t in their best interests.\nIn fact, a study done by the Economist Intelligence Unit found that inadequate communication can result in:\nA failure to complete projects in about 45% of cases.\nLow team member morale in a third of cases.\nMissed performance goals in one out of four cases.\nWhich leads us to this conundrum.\nWe have more ways than ever to communicate with each other. Text, email, Zoom, Slack, phone calls, Skype, and in-person chats are just the teeny-tiny tip of the iceberg. So why is poor communication—or none at all—still among the top 5 reasons software projects fail?\nWhat’s Behind Poor Communication\nPeople often jest that only developers can understand developers, so “normies” shouldn’t be upset when the communications process goes south during the development process. We think that’s a bit of a misnomer, as we’ve worked with plenty of product managers, marketing folks, and product owners who “get it.”\nOn the other hand, we’ve been at it long enough to know there are software developers who are difficult to communicate with. But that’s something you could say of any profession.\nHere’s what we’ve found often happens, particularly with outsourced software development: communications break down, resulting in a product wildly inconsistent with your vision.\nWorking on any software project requires a predefined plan for effective communication. Sounds straightforward enough, but in truth it’s a tough thing to work on and maintain during a project’s life. That’s because most people’s communication skills reflect what they were taught at an early age. Overcoming problematic approaches to communicating typically takes a lot of work and a change in mindset.\nLuckily, keeping the communication channels open and dialogue flowing during the development process can be made a heckuva lot easier by embracing a few principles that help you:\nBreak through language barriers.\nCommunicate your vision.\nUse the right communication tools.\nSince establishing a good communication policy with your software development team is the cornerstone of every successful project, let’s dig in and discover how to put these three tenets into practice.\nBreaking Through Language Barriers\nIs there such a thing as “developer speak?” Most product managers will tell you yes. Keep in mind, though, that it doesn’t need to be a barrier to effective communication. After all, it’s just as easy to say there’s “sales speak,” “finance speak,” and “marketing speak,” right?\nSoftware projects usually bring together various professionals from varying departments, each with their own way of talking but with a common goal: delivering a great product to the market. It’s a product manager’s job to bridge any dialect gap and make sure that happens. And, more often than not, that means knowing how to decipher developer speak.\nTips to Avoid Communication Breakdown\nFor instance, if you say to a developer, “That’s not difficult to code, right?” you might hear back, “That’s not exactly how agile development works.” What they’re really saying, though, is, “you’re going to have to trust me to determine how hard something is or how long it’s going to take.”\nWe’re now at the proverbial fork in the road:\n1. Does each party get the subtlety of the exchange and keep moving forward?\n2. Or do one or both get offended and frustrated?\nUnfortunately, a majority of people choose the path most taken (#2) and communications start to go to pieces.\nThis is where having a product owner in the middle can make things easier, as their role in the agile development process is to translate a product manager’s strategy into actionable tasks and work with agile teams to carry out requirements.\nCommunicating Your Vision to Software Developers\nNow that we know that communicating with developers isn’t typically the same as with other stakeholders, here’s how you can tweak your usual messaging style to efficiently and effectively communicate with your development team and get the product you envision.\nKnow your requirements. If you’re not entirely clear on what you want, don’t expect your developers to fill in the gaps. Good developers will ask a lot of questions. However, as a business owner you know your market better than anyone and it is extremely valuable to be the expert in your space.\nPut it in writing. No one understands your market or your users like you do. Even simple sketches and wireframes can go a long way in helping developers understand what you want to do and how you want it to look.\nEducate yourself on the development process. Agile development is fast, but it also requires thorough planning. Since nailing down a good interface structure might be the most crucial part of software design, it can also help to learn how wireframes work and how they can save you time upfront and mitigate adjustments down the road.\nLearn to crawl before you walk. It’s always best to begin small and make sure a few things work correctly before taking the next step. Everyone changes software once they see it in action. Small wins are more powerful than you might think.\nBe ready for questions. Your developers will make hundreds, if not thousands, of decisions for you over the course of a project’s life. However, they will have questions only you can answer. Making yourself unavailable or avoiding answering because you don’t want to make a misstep can quickly close down the lines of communication.\nDon’t assume. Avoid saying things like, “that’ll only take a couple hours, right?” Developers hope you’re right, but they also know it could take weeks. Or it might be impractical or technically impossible.\nLastly, you’d be surprised at how many people lose interest in their software projects as time goes by. If you feel yourself reaching this point, redouble your efforts to say involved. And keep communicating with your developers on a regular basis.\nMost Effective Communication Tools for Clients and Software Developers\nGood communication may be challenging, but today you have more tools than ever designed to help make it simpler.\nSlack and Google Meet combine the best of live chat and email so people can communicate on and through various devices. You can also create collaborative boards, especially helpful on projects with larger teams.\nClickUp puts tasks, docs, goals, and more in one place and is great for keeping everyone on the same page about a project’s various stages.\nConceptShare eliminates email chains and helps streamline review and approval processes and workflow automation.\nOur countless ways of communicating make matching business and developer communication platforms imperative. Both sides of the aisle should strive to find a method that works best for everyone.\nTips to Avoid Communication Breakdown When Outsourcing Software Developers\nLike everything else in life, fixing a communication problem begins with admitting you have one. These quick tips will help keep the lines open over your project’s lifespan:\n1. Develop a communication plan at the start. It should set out event and stakeholder-specific protocols as well as communication channels.\n2. Decide which communication tool will be used for specific situations. For example, phone calls for urgent matters and Zoom for weekly updates.\n3. Build a culture of communication that prioritizes transparency. For instance, no development team is perfect, and it’s important to give it room to improve as the project progresses. The last thing you want is a team that claims up every time there’s an issue for fear of criticism.\nMost Effective Communication Tools for Clients and Software Developers\n4. One of the most powerful and impactful things you can do for your developers is identifying your communication style’s weak points and find ways to fix them.\n5. Practice what’s called “deliberate communication,” taking into consideration things like the other person’s communication style, their preferred channel, and the message’s necessity.\nWhat to Expect when Communicating with Zibtek’s Outsourced Software Developers\nSo many things can go sideways in software development. You can keep things on the straight and narrow by building and maintaining a high-quality communication approach.\nWe’re committed to providing our clients with superior, consistent communications throughout a project’s lifecycle that ensures needs and expectations are met. Whether your project is big or small, each of our developers and teams reports daily on their activity, and our project and delivery managers ensure you’re kept current with written status updates and are provided access to shared documents and files.\nTo learn more, reach out to us today.

It’s obviously not going to be the same across every industry but fundamentally, it’s the core components that allow services to function.\nNo service or organization can function if there isn't a foundation that provides day to day support. This can be in the form of communications, troubleshooting, transport, human resources, etc. It’s importance is particularly felt in the information technology industry.\nWhat does infrastructure support mean in the context of IT?\nIn the context of information technology, infrastructure support refers to all of the physical and digital resources that are required to support the flow, analysis, and storage of data. These can be a mix of software, hardware, systems and services that are used by the company to support its IT service.\nThe Information Technology Infrastructure Library's Foundation Course Glossary further explains that IT infrastructure includes all Information Technology but not the associated people, processes, and documentation. At its core, then, IT infrastructure refers to the components needed for the successful operation and management of an IT environment.\nInfrastructure support for apps\nApps are a great way to deliver intended business outcomes. Whether you use them to help your employees do their jobs better or to track any number of data points that really help you optimize the efficiency of your sales operation, apps are vital to success in this day and age.\nWhat most people don't understand, though, is that a robust infrastructure is required in support of these apps. They can't provide the kind of benefit that you're looking to get out of them if there's not a support infrastructure behind them. To put it simply, a support infrastructure provides the app with a complete ecosystem.\nFor example, if your app is for managing warehouse employees, it wouldn't make sense for it to be based on an international cloud solution. An on-premise data center will be a much better option since the app isn't meant to be used by anybody other than the people in your warehouse.\nThat’s just one simple example of what infrastructure support can look like for apps. It needs to be built around what the app’s core purpose is, so that the effective implementation helps realize the true potential of your custom app.\nWhat you need for proper infrastructure support:\nApplistructure\nFor proper infrastructure support, you need what's commonly known in the industry as Applistructure. It's best described as a blent of applications and technological infrastructure, a single point of ownership and accurate mapping of both. The adoption of Applistructure has really been driven over the years by the need for enhanced integration and convergence.\nEnsuring this single point of ownership helps take the stress out of a lot of different scenarios. Whether you're worried if your app will be up and running in time or if it keeps suffering from the same issues over and over again, the Applistructure will provide a holistic view of the infrastructure and apps as one single, seamless entity.\nThe Applistructure concept really started picking up steam in the mid-2000s. It was presented as a viable option for companies that were looking to get the most out of their technology and application investments. The idea was to create a more flexible support base for their app activities.\nIntrusion Detection System\nNetwork security is still one of the biggest challenges that all IT-enabled businesses face. With cyber threats increasing with each passing day, any leak of corporate information or user data can literally be the difference between life and death for a company.\nThat's why an intrusion detection system is crucial for proper infrastructure support. The timely detection of an intrusion can help you get a handle on the situation much earlier, and potentially prevent any major losses from occurring.\nApp managers and developers can't be in the dark about suspicious activity on the network. It's only when they're alerted about it can they go about finding out where the vulnerability exists and how they're going to patch it.\nApplication Server\nAn application server is a mixed framework of software that sits as a layer between the network and the database. It supports the creation of web apps and provides a server environment for them. It hosts and operates the app and all of its associated services for the end users.\nIn technical terms, an application server is one that's primarily meant to run applications. This server, however, can include both the hardware and the software that's required for the app to function. The distinction between app and web servers is important, because while the latter may not have any problems serving web pages, it may not have the required resources to run demanding apps.\nThe application server may need to be optimized or scaled if your apps are to be updated with additional functionality or if it needs to support a lot more users than what it was originally intended for. It needs to be built and maintained with scalability in mind, and proper support for the app can’t be possible otherwise.\nCohesion between app and infrastructural development teams\nThe app and infrastructural development teams can’t be working in isolation, without any cohesion and collaboration. The provision of ongoing support has to be a consideration for the app even before development work starts on it. Judging the requirements for support is fairly easy, with the app's requirement being the core blueprint for the type of infrastructure it's going to require.\nThe guidelines may include the compute and storage requirements for the app since some databases might require a significant amount of storage, particularly if it’s an app that provides data archiving functionality. Others may not need as much storage but be more resource intensive nonetheless.\nTherefore, it's important that both the app and infrastructural development teams work together closely so that things can be done right the first time. The wrong infrastructure is going to cause problems for the app in the long run and if you're forced to replace it, that's going to be an additional burden on the bottom line that could have easily been avoided the first time around.\nAn understanding of app adoption\nWhether it's an app meant for warehouse employees or for the public, you should have a good idea of the adoption rates for the app. How many people could end up using it, what source of strain would that put on the infrastructure, and what additional resources might be required to provide a consistent user experience\nThis will go a long way in making it easier for you to scale up or down without having the app suffer from poor performance and networking issues. A fluid support infrastructure would complement this since it's going to leave a much wider room for scalability.\nIt can happen with apps meant for the public more often than not. A lot more people end up using the app than you had initially estimated. This causes all sorts of problems when trying to get the app to scale up but it’s not really that easy to do that without the proper infrastructure support in place.\nInfrastructure support only comes from proper, high-quality app development.\nBefore you can worry about what sort of infrastructure support your app is going to require, the first step is obviously to have an app developed. You can either put your in-house development team on it, if you happen to have one, or you can outsource the job to an app development service provider.\nApp development is a highly competitive market so you’ll quickly have more service providers vying for your business than you may have imagined. Who you decide to pick really depends on a variety of factors, chief among those is the budget that you have to get the app developed.\nYou'll not want to compromise on the quality of the app and for precisely that reason, you'll want to partner with a developer that's highly experienced in designing and building great apps. That’s precisely what the team at Zibtek can achieve for you.\nZibtek has been in the app development business for well over a decade.

    "extractedText": "Software Maintenance: Understanding the 4 Main Types\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n30 APR 2019 • 4 MIN READ\nWhat is software maintenance?\nSoftware maintenance will be needed periodically as hardware systems are affected by pollution, weather, and atmospheric conditions. Since software systems often have dependencies within their working environment, the software will eventually lose its value if it does not undergo a maintenance task, regular qa and support is required for optimal performance.\nHere are a few examples that can cause a software system to lose its value:\nA website that validates authentic users using Google authentication stops working because Google modifies its authentication protocol.\nAn instant messaging application becomes obsolete when a competitor releases a better messaging application.\nThe software that manages sales and orders in a company is not working properly because its compatible hardware is obsolete.\nAn application requires integration with new interfaces.\nOperating Systems get updated and your software needs to be updated\nIOS or Android updates and your app needs to be updated\nNew Security warnings go out and you need to patch your application to be protected.\nTo deal with these changing technologies and business environments, software maintenance is necessary.\nSoftware maintenance is the process of modifying and updating the software according to the customer’s requirements. Its purpose is to correct the fault and improve the software performance after it has been delivered to the customers.\nSoftware Maintenance: Why is it necessary?\nTo fix the bugs and errors in the software system.\nTo improve the functionality of the software to make your product more compatible with the latest marketing and business environments.\nTo remove outdated functions from your software that is inhibiting your product efficiency.\nTo improve your software performance.\nTypes of software maintenance\n1. Corrective Software Maintenance\nSoftware defects arise due to errors and faults in the design, logic, and code. Corrective maintenance (commonly referred to as “bug fixing”) addresses these errors and faults in your software system.\nCorrective changes in the software are required when:\nSoftware is not working the way it is expected due to some acute issues, such as faulty logic flow, incorrect implementation, invalid or incomplete tests, etc.\nThe software issues affect users after you have released the software.\nMost commonly, users create bug reports and send them as feedback to the company that designed the software. The company’s developers and testers then review the code and make corrective changes to the software accordingly. The purpose of bug reports is to enhance and improve the software.\nIf you detect and resolve the flaws in the software before users discover it, then the maintenance action is preventive or adaptive. However, if you fix the problem after getting bug reports from the user’s side, then it is corrective maintenance action.\nIf you are spending the majority of time dealing with corrective maintenance task then pay attention to the following:-\nAdopt a robust testing practice.\nDevelop high-quality code.\nFocus on the correct implementation of the design specification.\nEnhance your ability to anticipate the problems.\n2. Adaptive Software Maintenance\nAdaptive maintenance aims at updating and modifying the software when:\nThe platform in which your software operates is changing (due to technology, laws, policies, rules, operating system,etc.)\nYour customers need the product to interface with new hardware or software.\nYou have predicted defects in the software that will affect your customers in the future.\nSuppose you are running a web application and find that it is incompatible with a new version of Chrome's web browser through a pre-release beta version for developers. If you address this compatibility issue in your web application before the final stable release of Chrome, then you are performing an adaptive software maintenance task.\nHowever, if you wait for a stable release of the new version of Chrome, your customers will run into issues. Then the changes you perform after that to fix those issues is corrective maintenance task. It’s better to perform adaptive maintenance action quickly because delaying it will lead you to perform corrective maintenance later, which is a costly approach.\nNote that if you are modifying the environment in which your software lives, then it will trigger changes within other parts of your software as well. For example, updating the server, processors, compilers, etc. will also affect the functionality of your software.\n3. Perfective Software Maintenance\nPerfective software maintenance is performed when you update the software system to improve its value, according to user demands. This includes:\nSpeed optimization\nImprovement in user interfaces\nImprovements in software usability\nEnhancement of software functionality\nImprovement in software performance\nSome key points about Perfective software maintenance:\nIt involves making enhancements in software functionality by implementing new or changed user requirements (even when the changes are not considered a defect, error or fault).\nIt is often, but not always, initiated by customer feedback.\nIt accounts for 50% of all the maintenance activities.\nExamples of perfective maintenance include modifying an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) program to include a new payment settlement feature in a software system.\n4. Preventive Software Maintenance\nPreventive maintenance is a software change you make to prevent the occurrence of errors in the future. It increases the software maintainability by reducing its complexity. Preventive maintenance task include:\nUpdating the documentation: Updating the document according to the current state of the system.\nOptimizing the code: Modifying the code for faster execution of programs or making efficient use of storage space.\nReconstructing the code: Transforming the structure of the program by reducing the source code, making it easily understandable.\nDifference between adaptive and preventive maintenance\nUnderstanding the difference between adaptive and preventive maintenance can be difficult sometimes. To know the difference between these two maintenance tasks, read the following:\nPreventative maintenance is a natural consequence of software evolution.\nStaying on top of changing software trends will ensure continuing efficiency of your platform as well as present the best impression to your clients.\nAdaptive Maintenance allows your business to adjust the platform needs to changing software specifications. As your technology outlook grows and scales, adaptive maintenance ensures that your technology stack keeps up with your growth.\nWhether your upcoming plans call for preventive or adaptive maintenance, you can rest assured that our software experts have worked in one, the other, and sometimes combinations of the two.

    "extractedText": "STARTUPS\nLessons from Failed Startups: You Don’t Have to Learn the Hard Way\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n11 MAR 2019 • 4 MIN READ\nIt’s not hard to think of startups that folded. If you’ve spent any time in the startup space, you’ve seen software companies, novelty brands, and innovative companies that failed to grow. Lots of these failed startups had promising beginnings, getting accepted into StartX and Y Combinator which usually results in significant funding from venture capitalists. Despite these advantages, many companies fold after a few years, because they could not find the right product-market fit.\nWhen failed startups announce that they are winding down their operations, many people ask the founders several questions of the lessons that they have learned as a result of running a startup. Kent Mori, whose startup folded, has shared about the following lessons that he has learned from his experience. These lessons are essential for every startup that wants to find success.\nLessons Learned\n1. Build a Robust Framework\nAt an initial stage, most startups believe that they have a solution to one of the most critical problems in the world. They are operating under an assumption that someone is willing to pay to purchase that solution. They base this on experiences and intuition, and, as such, they are still assumptions or hypotheses that they need to verify.\nThe first thing that you may need to do is to build a framework that allows you not just to document your thoughts or hypotheses but also to test them. You need to have sufficient room to evaluate the hypotheses and make alterations to it as and when required. These are some of the questions that you may have to ask yourselves first:\nWhat are some of the assumptions that we need to test?\nWhat are the methods we are going to employ to test the hypotheses (e.g., conversing with the potential or existing customers, selling, landing pages)?\nWhen and how are you going to evaluate the results?\nWhat should you build if you want to conduct a test?\nWhat are some things we are working on and in what ways is it essential?\nHow is our progress when you compare it with the last week? What are the results that we have got by doing some tests?\nWhat are some things we can do to move this faster?\nThese are some excellent questions that you may need to ask yourself to guide the discussions. It helps your company to not only progress but also to prioritize things.\n2. Runway Versus Hypotheses\nMany startups want to spend there, often limited, resources prudently. They choose to use lean principles to cut down the costs and focus on using the money to maximize the runway. If this is your goal as well, you need to reconsider. Your main aim should be instead to increase the total number of hypotheses that you can test using that money.\nAt Mori’s now-closed startup, one of the most significant pain points for the customer is about lead time that is pretty slow, and there were problems with the quality of the product. At many startups, the management thought that using technology they could quickly solve the problem. Since the factories were doing a terrible job when it came to adopting the technology, one startup considered two options:\nOpen a micro-factory in China with less than 20 staff members.*\nBuild a service team based in China with less than five staff members. *\nAfter much thought, the management chose to go for option number two as they thought it would maximize the runway.In retrospect, this was not the best approach. Instead, the management team realized it would have been right if the team went with option number one as it would have helped the company to identify deeper issues preventing the company from growing.\n3. Sales Led by the Founder\nIt is best if the founders work on sales in the initial stage. Bringing in a VP of sales right from the beginning might not be a good idea. And another thing might be taking too much time before you send them out if you already hired a person. Sales that you make before identifying the product-market fit is not about generating revenue. Many startups fail to realize this and thus have learned this principle the hard way.\nNow, this is the period that you can use to talk with the customers, learn about the problems that they are facing and then test solutions. Always remember that a sale is nothing but a successful byproduct of a test that is successful. Only a founder likes to see a product evolving drastically. Plus this will give you some idea of the characteristics that a person needs to have before you select them.\n4. Focus on One Stream\nIt is always good to have your company focus and do only one thing at a time. Focusing on two or three things at the same time can diffuse your efforts and prevent progress. Most failed startups started their company with their focus on one single problem that they wanted to solve. But after a year they often choose to do one more thing. As a result, they were unable to move toward success. Splitting time and resources can affect the project adversely.\nThese are some things that will fail any startup; Mori’s company is just one of those startups that became a victim of these things. By following these simple principles, you can do well and can help your business succeed. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

    "extractedText": "HIRING\nWhat Is Really A Productive Workplace?\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n27 FEB 2019 • 4 MIN READ\nLanding an exciting job can seem like a dream come true. But if the work environment is poorly structured that dream job can quickly turn into a nightmare. If you’re entering a workplace with no work-life balance, you could start missing out on other essentials in life, devoting all your time to the job. Things like missing important events in your children’s lives can start to take a toll.\nBurnout\nEmployees work long hours and are absent from the home most of the time may soon realize that they are losing things more precious than money. But most people are okay with this, because they are working in an excellent job and they have dreams to progress.\nMany people do realize what they are missing and question themselves often, but then they shrug the thought away, because they have an exciting career in front of them. They might think everything is going to be alright once that person reaches the position that they like in a year or two.\nNow, there is still a risk that employees in this situation will damage their relationships with their children and spouse. And these things will affect them adversely, both in an out of the workplace. They start to vent their frustration at their office. Some of them begin to mistreat their colleagues as a result of their personal frustrations. Soon the person will end up missing meetings and not doing things at work that they once enjoyed.\nThis situation is generally called “burnout,” and it is prevalent in many high pressure work environments in startups and the tech industry generally. In order to escape burnout without quitting a high stress job, an employee has to make concrete changes in their day-to-day life and how they handle the work-life balance.\nThe Snake\nMany people call big problems in a place that no one wants to acknowledge or solve “the elephant in the room.” For this problem, we can use the metaphor “snake in the room.” Now, almost every office in the world has a snake in the room. In some firms, the snake is super aggressive and might attack a person brutally. But in some companies, they tame the snake pretty well.\nThe person who is bitten by the snake usually becomes uninvolved, short-tempered, lazy and quite distracted. In most cases, people do not know the fact that the snake has already bitten them. But some smart people recognize that they are facing some challenge but do not really investigate further into the matter.\nTalk More About This Condition\nAs per a research, around 37% of the workers in Canadian and American companies experience burnout. The primary reasons why this condition occurs is because there are heavy workloads, too much pressure and tight deadlines. Now, you cannot fix this problem with a one-size-fits-all solution, but there are some strategies that can put you on the path to success.\nThe Need for Hard Stops\nWe are making a big mistake by measuring the worth of a person only by checking the number of hours that he is busy. We want to ensure that he is having the right amount of work on his plate so that he can consistently make progress toward bigger goals. It is interesting to note that startups and entrepreneurs have now become more like a lifestyle than a business or a career. You can call it a religion as people are spending too much time on their work. Many people think being busy will somehow increase their status.\nIf you do not want to head for burnout, it is essential for you to take some time off your work by using hard stops. Use this time to relax and ponder but do nothing. While it is challenging, it can rejuvenate your mind, soul, and body. Many founders these days are taking a week off from their chores in the company. They call it “Think Week” wherein they spend time with their family and do nothing but relax before they return to their work.\nCreate a Work Environment That Boosts Happiness, Health, and Comfort\nIt is vital for you to ensure that the team that is working with you has flexible work hours. Because there is a particular group that likes to sleep well and prefers coming late to do the job and there might be some who want to go early to the workplace when there’s not much of a crowd. Also, people’s obligations outside work often have a significant effect on their prefered work hours.\nPeople should be able to get the flexible time option if it is something that is doable. Some companies also allow their employees to work from their homes a few days a week. Allowing employees some flexibility in their schedule will do much more to inspire productivity than dumping money into a new foosball table in the break room.\nEmployees should have the freedom to speak with their employer about things that will work well for them. It is essential for them and you to enjoy your time with your family if you want to work more efficiently and to avoid burnout. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

Your developer team is trying hard to fix the issues, but the debugging is challenging in the existing code. Then, developers find that it’s easier to rewrite the code from scratch than to spend a huge amount of time in fixing the bugs in the software whose code has not been written efficiently. But, at times, choosing to rewrite the code from scratch turns into a mess. It is a time-consuming process and can bring dissatisfaction to your customers. To help you with this, we have listed some useful tips on how to go about rewriting your code.\n1. Know when to rewrite the code\nBefore rewriting the code, you should first check if the software (whose code you are rewriting) is still maintainable (meaning fixing the software defaults and updating its functionalities as per user’s requirement) or not.\nThere is no need to rewrite the code from scratch if\nYou can improve your software performance or correct its issues by repairing its faulty components.\nYou can add new modules and functionalities to the existing code in order to meet the new demands of your customers.\nWhen to rewrite the code?\nYou should go for a complete rewriting of code only if you feel your software can no longer be maintained. Here are the reasons why your software is not in a maintainable state-\nIts compatible hardware is no longer available.\nThe software is so tightly coupled that it becomes hard to segment its modules into chunks and to add new modules into it.\nIts tools and techniques have become obsolete.\n2. Understand the difference between rewriting and refactoring\nTo determine if your software requires code refactoring or code rewriting, you should first understand the difference between these two.\nDifference between code refactoring and code rewriting\nCode refactoring vs Code rewriting\nIt means restructuring the existing code without changing the key functionalities of the software.\nIt means complete rewriting of code from scratch. It doesn’t change the end result of the code. It changes the end result of the code. It improves the readability and flexibility of the code and reduces dependencies within the code base, making it easier for developers to modify the code in the future.It is usually done to correct the defect in the software.\nWhile refactoring the code, the system should work the same way as it was working before. Due to this reason, it requires a huge amount of debugging and testing. And, while rewriting the code, the technology, prototypes, and architecture are completely free from legacy limitations. You should go for code rewriting if you want a complete change in the technology stack.\nThe chaos you face while rewriting and refactoring the code.\n(https://www.targetprocess.com/blog/refactoring-vs-rewrite/)\nThe green line in the graph shows how chaos changes with code refactoring.The black line in the graph shows how chaos changes with a complete rewrite.\nFrom the given graph, we can depict that:\nWhile code refactoring:\nChaos is increasing after every step of refactoring, but later the chaos decreases and application becomes stable.\nThere are many releases before the final release, enabling the product to evolve faster. Eventually, the final product will meet the customers’ requirements.\nIt is required to keep the system stable and working all the time.\nWhile code rewriting:\nDuring the rewriting phase, the chaos is constant but significantly increases after the final release of the product.\nStabilization period is longer, and the final release of the product is faster.\nWhen should you consider rewriting over refactoring?\nIf cost is your concern because restructuring the code is more expensive than doing a complete rewrite.\nIf the debugging process becomes challenging.\nIf you want a complete change in software technology and its architecture.\n3. Understand the associated risks\nTo rewrite an application, you need an experienced development team that can understand and interpret the existing software logic and then rewrite them in a new legacy system. You also need to translate your data and databases according to the new code base. After that, there will be a lengthy user testing process. Sometimes a full-scale rewrite of your software puts your business at risk. Ask the following questions to figure out if rewriting the code for your software is good for your business or not:\nQuestion no. 1 why do you want to rewrite the software?\nQuestion no. 2 What changes have you made in the software development process to make your product better than its previous version?\nQuestion no. 3 Do you have a clear idea about all the functionalities and features of your existing software?\nQuestion no. 4 Do you have test cases for the new features?\nQuestion no. 5 What will you do if the new version of the product has defects?\nQuestion no. 6 Do you need to migrate data from the old system to the new legacy system? If yes, then how will you do that?\nQuestion no. 7 Will the existing developers be performing the rewriting task? If yes, then what changes have you made to help them do a better job?\nQuestion no. 8 If you are hiring a new development team, then will they be able to coordinate well with original developers to understand the existing code?\nQuestion no. 9 Can developers approach the customers to understand their technology needs?\nQuestion no. 10 How will you deploy your new written code?\nAnswering these questions will help you uncover the risks and challenges associated with a complete rewrite. There will be fewer chances of delays, errors, cost overruns, and data loss.\n4. Decide whether to rewrite on-premises or to outsource\nBefore deciding whether to rewrite the code at your own premises or to outsource, ask the following questions:\nAre your existing tools and application packages at your premises good enough to meet technological needs?\nDo you have time, skills, and expertise to rewrite the software on-premises?\nIf any of the answers to these questions is no, then it’s better to go for outsourcing. But, managing outsourced team requires special skillsets and expertise. Read the following to know how to master the host of challenges while managing an outsourced team.\nHow to manage the outsourcing team?\nDefine your requirements precisely and clearly.\nAssign the modules that you want to be developed by the outsourcing vendor.\nPlan a meeting with their development team for seamless integration of codes in your new code base.\nPlan a meeting with their quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) teams to determine best QA and QC procedures.\nMonitor the timelines you have given to them.\nGive them regular feedback about the code modules or features they have built.\nSelecting the best-outsourced team for your product will provide your customers with superior services and increase your business productivity. But choosing the best outsourcing partner is a complex task because if you choose a company that is not experienced or does not know how to serve your business needs, then the result could be disastrous for your company.\nWhat factors to consider while choosing your outsourcing partner?\nReliability: Check the experience of the company and its history.\nProject experience: Check if they have experience in similar projects that you are about to outsource to them.\nReferences: Ask them for at least three references to see if their clients are satisfied with their work.\nSet properexpectations for cost\nMost of the time, the cost to rewrite the software goes to 5, 7, or even 10 times higher than the estimated cost.\nTo set proper estimation for cost, look at the following hidden costs you need to include:\nAccount for the features that the maintenance team will add later once the development team rebuilds the software.\nWhile rewriting the code, you need to migrate from the old legacy system to the new system. Add this migration cost into your overall estimate.\nAdd the maintenance cost of your old system that needs to be run in parallel while you are rewriting the code.\nAccount for the new demands of your customers (that can arise anytime) for the product that requires you to include new features.\nAdd the cost of hiring new developers.\nWhat to do after rewriting the code?\nOnce you rebuild the software, keep the following things in mind to keep your software up and running:\nDevote a large portion of your development time on defects and issues.\nAllocate time to adding new features.\nPlan to spend time upgrading methodologies, designs, and operating systems.

But when it comes time to put your own software development plan into action, you should know a lot more about what each of the major development models entails.\nThat way, you can choose the right method and the right team to develop your software, taking into account your budget, timeframe, and other relevant factors.\nWhat is a software development model?\nFirst, what is software development? According to Wikipedia, most pieces of software are developed for one of three reasons: business use, personal use, or consumer use.\nClient or business software (which often takes the form of custom software) is software that’s designed to meet the requirements of a particular business or industry.\nConsumer software (including commercial and open-source software) refers to software that’s developed with the intent to be shared or sold to individual users.\nAnd personal software is developed to meet the needs of a particular user, such as a developer writing code to assist in the completion of ongoing tasks.\nRegardless of the end goal of your software, there are several other factors to take into account, such as whether your software is being developed alongside a product -- as is the case with an operating system for a smartphone, for example.\nAlso, your budget, timeframe, and the size and structure of your team, may impact the way you choose to develop your product.\nSoftware development includes everything from planning and designing your software, to testing it, deploying it, and maintaining it after it’s released.\nRather than start from scratch each time, developers have created several models or frameworks they use to structure the development process.\nThese include everything from free-flowing, flexible methods to structured techniques with their own terminology and training programs.\nFrom start to finish, this process is known as the software development life-cycle, or SDLC, and helps keep your development team on track.\nHere are some of the most popular software development models and how/why they work.\nWhy would you choose one model over another? Essentially, different approaches are right for different kinds of teams and types of software. Some projects require top-down direction to meet a client’s needs or be finished in a tight time-frame. Others can afford to be more adaptable and allow teams to organize themselves.\nLet’s look at some of the pros and cons to each of these seven models:\nWaterfall\nThe waterfall model is one of the oldest software development models, and is based on techniques used in manufacturing and other physical industries.\nEssentially, it’s a sequential approach in which each step comes after the next, without any overlap between phases.\nThe rationale is that by completing each phase before moving to the next phase, you’ll catch bugs before they become an issue.\nYou can also better estimate how long the entire SDLC will take, and set aside a portion of your schedule for each stage in the process, with the bulk of it on coding.\nThe method was originally outlined by Winston W. Royce in 1970, with six main phases:\nRequirements\nAnalysis\nDesign\nCoding\nTesting\nOperations\nThe waterfall model also calls for extensive documentation, making it easy for new team members to catch up on what happened before they arrived.\nThe downside is that this is a more rigid approach, so it’s harder to change course if the terms of your project change. It also doesn’t provide the option of releasing an MVP, or minimum viable product, early in the research and development phase.\nAs a result, some developers use a modified waterfall that allows for some overlapping phases, which we’ll look at later.\nV-model\nThe V-model is similar to the waterfall model in that it’s also a very linear process with a clearly-defined workflow. However, the V-model places more emphasis on verification and validation, with the development and testing stages happening side-by-side.\nThe validation process may include stages such as unit testing, integration testing, and systems testing that are less of a focus in the waterfall model.\nThe main benefit to the V-model is its focus on quality control, making it a popular model for government agencies and large, bureaucratic industries that can’t afford mistakes.\nBut just like the waterfall method, it can be too rigid for some projects, and requires an up-front investment in time and money.\nThat’s why this model is chosen by companies that want to spare no expense in getting it right, to reduce the risk of bugs or downtime later.\nIncremental and Iterative\nThe incremental and iterative model is very much what it sounds like: instead of taking a linear, sequential approach, this model is more flexible.\nDevelopers using this approach may still apply waterfall and V-model techniques, but in smaller stages, sometimes referred to as “mini waterfalls.”\nThis allows for subsequent stages to incorporate new ideas or requirements that weren’t included in the initial stage, without having to start all over again.\nMultiple iterations of the software may be in development at the same time (sometimes referred to as parallel development) or in back-to-back cycles.\nThis approach can result in a shorter development timeframe, as each cycle can build on the next, using interchangeable parts or modules.\nThe limitations to this approach include more input required from the customer or client, and a reduced capacity to handle larger, non-iterative components.\nSpiral\nThe spiral model is another customer-oriented model that is built around risk analysis. It makes use of prototypes, simulations, and continuous project evaluations.\nIt’s designed for projects in which the goal is vague or unclear, and more information is needed to determine the best path forward.\nThe amount of effort put into each stage is based on reducing total risk. For example, the time spent testing a product must be balanced against the risk that a competitor brings the product to market before you do.\nThe spiral model takes these risks into account, cycling through the process repeatedly until a sufficient degree of confidence has been reached.\nThe spiral model is great for projects that require client or user feedback, but can be a time-consuming process that can, true to its name, spiral out of control if there isn’t a clear timeline for delivering a product.\nRUP (Rational Unified Process)\nThe Rational Unified Process was developed by the Rational Software Company, now a part of IBM. It’s a flexible model that includes both linear and iterative approaches.\nThe four main stages are: Inception, Elaboration, Construction, and Transition. Each of these stages can have multiple iterations.\nThe key to the RUP model is that all of the activities that go into software development are “active” throughout the process, but at various levels of intensity.\nYou can think of it as a graph with peaks and valleys. The business modeling activities peak during the Inception phases, and gradually reduce in intensity.\nTesting and deployment peak during the latter phases, while implementation is mostly active during the Construction period.\nThe benefit to RUP is a linear process, but with fewer discrete stages than the waterfall model. Activities can rise and fall based on their relevance to each phase.\nSCRUM\nThe Scrum model is one of the most well-known software development models, and is based on the agile development methodology.\nAs its name implies, agile development is flexible and adaptive. It encourages a greater degree of collaboration, and prioritizes cross-functional teams.\nThe Scrum model is specifically intended for small teams with no more than 10 people on each team, and requires daily 15-minute meetings called scrums.\nThe model accounts for “requirements volatility” -- or the expectation that the client’s needs may change -- and encourages adaptation and use of the empirical process.\nInstead of linear stages, tasks are broken up into goal-based periods called “sprints,” which typically last for two weeks to a month.\nScrum includes three main roles: the development team; the product owner, who acts as a liaison between the customer and the team; and the scrum master, who facilitates the process and makes sure that the scrum model is applied properly.\nBecause Scrum is designed for small teams, it places less emphasis on scalability and documentation, and more focus on customer satisfaction on a tight timeframe.\nXP (Extreme Programming)\nFinally, there’s extreme programming, which prioritizes short development timeframes and the continuous integration of software.\nThis means that development teams can respond more quickly to user feedback, and release new iterations of the product on a regular basis.\nBecause each development phase takes only 1 or 2 weeks, a big part of XP is having automated testing procedures in place, including unit and acceptance testing.\nXP requires frequent code review, including pair programming, in which one developer codes while another observes their work for accuracy and efficiency.\nXP is built around software engineering rather than project management, so it requires a different set of skills and programming style.\nNo matter your model, find someone that can help you develop the right software for the right job.\nThese are seven of the most common software development models, each of which has its own pros and cons, depending on your timeline, budget, and more. Whichever model you use, you’ll need a developer who can take your existing workflow into account. The team at Zibtek offers software development, mobile development, QA testing, and more, and can adapt to your existing workflows, including waterfall and scrum models.

After all, you’ve dreamed of the day you could afford to cruise the streets in style. You’ve watched commercials and YouTube videos, inserting yourself behind the wheel, imagining the envious glances from friends and strangers.\nYet even though you know deep in your heart the old way of getting around town just isn’t cutting it anymore, you’re fixated on the investment’s risks. What if you choose the wrong make and model? Can you really afford the monthly payments? What if the dealer takes you for the rube you are? Experiencing buyer’s remorse before you even make a purchase can get in the way of experiencing the joy you’ve rightfully earned.\nIn many ways, the same can be said of outsourcing Python development services. Perhaps up until now, your in-house development team has kept up with your software needs and expectations. But recently you’ve realized it might be time for an upgrade—aka outsourcing—to get more advanced, reliable, and efficient solutions.\nIf you’re like many of our clients, two of your biggest worries with outsourcing software development are working with the unknown and costs. In this post, we’re talking about the\ntop four ways to mitigate the risks associated with the first worry. By following these guidelines, you’ll happily discover that the second concern, for all intents and purposes, takes care of itself.\nSo You’ve Decided to Outsource Python Development Services\nCongratulations! Now that you’ve decided outsourcing Python development services is a must for your company, it’s time to discuss how you can ensure a stress-free experience that results in an exceptional product.\n4 Ways to Mitigate Risk with Outsourced Python Development Services\nClear Communication\nEvery relationship is improved when it includes open and honest communication.

It’s where the unconventional thrives and the untried becomes cutting-edge.\nYou might or might now know that the Python programming language is named after the famed British comedy troupe. Its inventor, Guido van Rossum, wanted a name that was unique and slightly mysterious. As luck would have it, he happened to be reading the published scripts from “Monty Python’s Flying Circus,” the 1970s BBC comedy series, as he was developing the multipurpose language. And thus, Python was born.\nHow to Choose the Right Python Development Company for My Project\nWhen searching for a Python development company, you’d be well served to look for one that offers as innovative an approach to Python development services as Monty Python did for sketch comedy.

    "extractedText": "PYTHON\nTop Reasons Why Python Development is Widely Used in Enterprises\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n26 OCT 2019 • 5 MIN READ\nIn this digital landscape, enterprises are adopting smart solutions in order to strengthen their financial operations and productivity. To maintain a competitive edge in the marketplace, many business firms are investing hugely in enterprise software development. Enterprise software is an application that is designed to meet the needs of organizations. For enterprise software development, Python is the favorite language due to its robustness and versatility. In the last few years, Python has shown incredible growth and emerged as the most popular programming language. If you want to know why Python programming language is ideal for business firms then here is some information to get you started.\nTop Reasons Why Python Development is Widely Used in Enterprise\n1. Highly scalable\nPython facilitates versatility in the application, enabling developers to handle various tasks of different sizes. The following things make Python scalable:\nMulti-programming paradigm support\nIt supports multiple programming paradigms, including an object-oriented approach, functional programming, and procedural programming. This multiple support for programming paradigms makes Python a well-suited language for enterprises. This is because a single programming paradigm cannot resolve most complex issues, whereas the language that supports multi-programming paradigms has the ability to solve issues effectively, making the application robust and scalable at the same time.\nInterpreted language\nPython is an interpreted language, meaning, it executes the code line-by-line, taking one program instruction at a time (this is in contrast with compiled programming languages that execute all programs at once). Being an interpreted language, Python enables developers to create scripts and code on a larger scale quickly. This, in turn, reduces the development time.\n2. Vast library and frameworks\nPython offers a wide range of ready-made libraries and frameworks for free. Developers can use these libraries and frameworks to build powerful software quickly with a cost-effective approach. This, in turn, reduces the development cost for the enterprises.\nExamples of some popular Python libraries and frameworks include:\nScikit-learn: It is used for machine learning, data analysis, and data mining.\nTensorflow: It is the popular library for Python, developed by Google. It is used to create features and functionalities of deep learning modules including, image recognition, face recognition and more.\nKeras: It is used in machine learning (for creating neural networks).\nNumpy: It is used for scientific computing and mathematical operations.\nPandas: It contains a high-performance data structure that developers used in analyzing various modules.\nSome popular Python frameworks\nDjango: Django is a secure, reliable and efficient framework for larger and complex applications. It enables developers to build highly customizable apps quickly.\nFlask: It is a microframework that enables developers to build highly flexible, lightweight and small applications, with less effort and time. Unlike Django, Flask cannot be used to build large and complex applications.\nPyramid: It brands itself as “start small but finish big”, meaning you can simply get started with designing your applications and Pyramid will scale your application effectively as your project grows.\nTornado: Tornado is an asynchronous networking library. With its non-blocking network I/O, it scales tens of thousands of open connections, making itself suitable for WebSockets, long polling, etc.\n3. Easy to learn and understand\nIn business projects, the quality of the application and its development speed plays a vital role. Python helps developers in building quality applications in less time. With Python, it is easy to review the code written by others. Developers can check, review and debug the Python code seamlessly. This speeds up the development and testing process, reducing the time-to-market for applications.\nPython is one of the most simple and easily understandable languages. It is easy to use and learn because of it’s clean, structured and clear syntax. Its code is similar to the English language and highly readable. This, in turn, makes its writing process highly intuitive. Python language is suitable for various types of applications (including machine learning, scientific computations, artificial intelligence, robotics, etc.) because of its low learning curve. Even people with little programming experience can easily learn Python. As any complex programming language with a high learning curve will delay the development process, Python is a popular language among developers, testers and data engineers.\n4. Extensive open-source environment\nPython has a huge and robust ecosystem that is well-suited for enterprise usage. All the modern versions of Python are certified by the Open Source Initiative and copyrighted under a GPL compatible license. This means you can take advantage of Python’s ecosystem without paying any subscription fees. It open-source environment/ecosystem includes:\nA wide range of web frameworks such as Flask, Django, Pyramid, etc.\nVarious libraries for game development, image processing, machine learning, and data science and computer vision, such as Pandas, SciPy, IPython, NumPy, etc.\nInternet protocol support for HTML, JSON, XML,IMAP, FTP, Sockets, etc., in its standard library.\nWith the Python Package Index (software repository for Python), you can find and install ready-to-use software built by the Python community, speeding up the development process.\nPython has a vast community. If any complexities arise in your project, then the community can help resolve issues and bugs in your applications.\nCompanies using Python\nHave a look at the big companies that are presently using Python:\nNetflix has used Python in most of its application modules and components.\nFacebook and Instagram have used Python to deal with data analysis and data processing.\nSpotify has used Python for data analysis in its back-end.\nA wide range of the Reddit application is written in Python.\nGoogle also has explanatory documentation of Python.\nConclusion\nReasons why Python is suitable for business firms:\nDue to its vast and open-source libraries and framework, it enables developers to build a wide variety of high-quality applications in less time.\nPython is a versatile language. Applications written in Python can easily be scalable if your project requires any enhancements in the future.\nPython is simple and easy to learn and understand. Due to its simplicity, clean syntax, and low-learning curve, it is the favorite language among developers, data scientists, artificial intelligence and machine learning scientists. With Python, you can speed up your development process and reduce the time-to-market.\nPython has an extensive open-source environment, offering you a wide range of free and open-source toolkits, frameworks and IP support for its standard library. This makes Python a cost-effective approach among enterprises.\nNeed amazing enterprise applications, using a python development company can help. Contact us today!

    "extractedText": "SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT\nJava vs Python\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n1 OCT 2019 • 4 MIN READ\nUndoubtedly, Python and Java are the two most popular programming languages in the digital marketplace because of their efficiency, robustness, and versatility. In order to help you find which programming language (between Java and Python) will fit your business goal better, we have listed key differences between Java and Python. Let’s start with the history and definitions of Java and Python.\nHistory and Definition\nJava vs Python\n1. In terms of speed, Java is faster than Python\nJava executes code faster than Python. This is because Python is an interpreted language, whereas Java is a compiled programming language. Before delving into this point, let’s understand what the terms interpreted and compiled mean.\nThe differences between Interpreted and Compiled programming language\nWhy is Java faster than Python?\nBeing a compiled programming language, Java compiles all the code before execution, displaying all the errors at one time. Whereas, Python is an interpreted language that compiles the code and executes it simultaneously, line-by-line, displaying the error of each line of code one by one. This, in turn, makes Java faster than Python.\nFor an illustration of this, look at the screenshot that represents the execution speed, memory requirement, clock speed of CPU (in GHz) and CPU load of Java and Python:\n2. In terms of legacy, Python is more effective than Java\nWhen it comes to making changes to the existing legacy systems, Python is more robust and effective than Java. Adapting a legacy system is easier with Python than in Java because as compared to Python, Java code is more expressive. Unlike Java, Python can seamlessly make a gradual shift from the old legacy system to the modern system, without requiring developers to fully refactor and rewrite the code.\n3. Java code is more extended than Python\nPython code is small as compared to Java. Let’s take the examples of Python and Java programs reading a file.\nProgram in Java: Reading a file\nimport java.io.*;\npublic class ReadFromFile2\n{\npublic static void main(String[] args)throws Exception\n{\nFile file = new File(\"C:UsersdanielDesktoptest.txt\");\nBufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file));\nString st;\nwhile ((st = br.readLine()) != null)\nSystem.out.println(st);\n}\n}\nProgram in Python: Reading a file\n> f = open(\"test.txt\",'r',encoding = 'utf-8')\n>>> f.read()\nFrom the above examples, you can see that java took 10 lines of code to complete the same program that Python completed in two lines of code.\n4. Code readability of Python is better than Java\nJava emphasizes more syntax whereas Python follows the indentation process. For instance, if you forget to insert a semicolon or curly brackets within the code (wherever it is required) when using Java, then your code will show an error. On the other hand, Python doesn’t require you to add semicolons or curly brackets within the code. In Python, you just need to take care of the indentation. The indentation format of Python increases its code readability.\nHave a look at the code samples of Java and Python. You can see that the Python indentation approach makes it easily readable and understandable.\nJava code sample:\nclass programming {\nprogramming() {\nsystem.out.println(\"Constructor method called\");\n}\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\nprogramming object = new programming();\n}\n}\nPython code sample:\nclass Student:\ndef __init__(self, name):\nprint(\"This is parameterized constructor\")\nself.name = name\ndef show(self):\nprint(\"Hello\", self.name)\nstudent = Student(\"Daniel\")\nstudent.show()\n5. Java is statically typed whereas Python is dynamically typed\nBefore going into details, let's understand the difference between statically typed language and dynamically typed language.\nDifference between static and dynamic typed language\nBeing a statically typed language, Java catches errors in the early stage only (before the execution of the program). Whereas, being a dynamically typed language, sometimes Python encounters unexpected errors. But everything comes with its own strengths and weaknesses. Unlike Java, Python allows you to change its variable type in the code later in the program, ensuring flexibility and scalability.\n6. Unlike Java, Python is more popular for scientific and number-crunching applications\nJava is mostly built for general-purpose programming, including web and mobile applications. Whereas Python is mostly popular for numeric and scientific applications, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science, the Internet of Things (IoT) and more. This is because:\nPython is easy to learn, understand and implement. Even beginners with basic technical knowledge can easily learn and write Python code. With Python, developers don’t need to think about software engineering constraints; therefore they can focus more on building heuristically and algorithms related to machine learning, artificial intelligence, data science, etc.\n(However, Python can also be used to build web applications, but Java is still the preferred language for web applications and mobile applications.)\nPython comes with a wide range of libraries for artificial intelligence and machine learning, like: TensorFlow, Pytorch (neural-network library for deep-learning), matplotlib, scikit (data visualization library), Scikit-learn (library for data analysis, data mining and machine learning).\nJava vs Python trends\nJava is not as trendy as it once was. However, still, it is the most popular language among developers and enterprises. On the other hand, Python has grown at an unprecedented rate in the last few years, and the reason is: its ease of use and implementation, language flexibility, huge community support and more.\nWant to build powerful applications, using a python development company can help?

Today, it is one of the most powerful languages used to build a wide variety of applications. There are various reasons to use Python, but the primary reason to use Python is that it is one of the most flexible, robust and simple languages with huge code libraries and frameworks available in the market today.\nIn this article, we are going to list out some interesting functionalities that you can do with Python. Have a look.\nDon't forget to check out our practical agile series of posts.\nInteresting things you can do with Python\n1: Automating your daily routine tasks\nPython can be used to automate the routine, tedious tasks that consume your time on a daily basis. With Python, you can make your everyday life easier.\nTasks that can be automated with Python:\nSearching files in the database or text in files\nUpdating, creating, and renaming the folders and files according to your requirements.\nSearching the web and creating dictionaries\nSending message notifications and reminder emails\nTracking and sorting invoices\nAutomating these tasks only requires you to write a few lines of code. Python is a simple and easy language that doesn’t require you to do a lot of coding.\n2. Automatically detects what’s in the image\nDetecting faces from a huge loop of images comes under Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technology. Before delving into how Python automatically detects the image, let’s understand why Python is popular among AI and ML scientists.\nWhy Python is popular for artificial intelligence and machine learning\nPython is a popular language for artificial intelligence and machine learning. AI and ML areas involve the gathering, analyzing, and processing of a huge amount of data on a daily basis. Most AI and ML professionals look for a language that can be easy to learn and understand, as any complex programming language can increase the learning curve for AI and ML scientists, leading to a delay in project development. So, they mostly prefer the Python language. Python syntax resembles the everyday English language, meaning AI and ML scientists can work with complex systems easily.\nOther features that make Python a perfect choice for AI and ML projects are:\nIt offers flexibility\nIt has a huge community support (a bunch of resources and documentation are available that enable you to build amazing products)\nIt is platform-independent, meaning it can run on any platform, including Windows, Linus, macOS, Unix and many more.\nHow can you make your device recognize images using Python?\nPython offers you the best and open-source face recognition library for free, known as face-recognition 1.2.3. You can use this library in your Python script and make your device recognize faces in images. With this, you can easily find the pictures of a particular person from a huge number of images. All this coding with Python can be done in just a few hours. Python makes the implementation of AI and ML easy.\nExample to show how easy it is to detect a face in photographs by using the Python library\nCode snippet:\nimport face_recognition 1.2.3\nimage = face_recognition.load_image_file(\"your_file.jpg\")\nface_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(image)\n3. Data analysis, manipulation and visualization\nIt is said that humans can perceive things better looking at visual data. Data scientists have the capability to gather a huge amount of unstructured data to analyze and synthesize it into structured visual content. This helps the companies to get actionable insights into their businesses.\nData scientists using Python libraries to make visualization charts\nWith Python, it is easy for data scientists to create visualization of their data. Python contains powerful libraries for visualization, including:\nMatplotlib: It is an amazing Python library embedded with a full 2D support but limited 3-D graphic support. It enables data scientists to create data bars, charts, plots, power spectra, histograms, etc., within a few lines of code.\nSeaborn: It is a Python library that can be used to create informative and visually appealing statistical graphical data. It provides various features including, color palettes, built-in themes, tools and functions that enable data scientists to extract, analyze, synthesize and format the complex data into simple and easily understandable visualizations.\nPanda: Python library for data manipulation and analysis\nPanda is the most powerful and popular library for data manipulation and data analysis. Its source code is highly optimized, providing accurate results to data scientists while performing data manipulation and analysis.\nExample to show how easy it is to create data visualization using Python\nLet's consider the following data set (created in Excel) to create a visualization in the form of the line chart:\nTo convert this data set into a line chart, data scientists need to:\nImport Python libraries (Matplotlib and Panda)\nThen, they have to assign the data integers, variables, parameters, etc., along with a few lines of Python code.\nHave a look at the code snippet:\nImporting data with Python libraries:\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\ndf=pd.read_excel(\"E:/First.xlsx\", \"Sheet1\")\nNote: In the code snippet, E:/First.xlsx, “sheet1” is the path of the file name ‘First.xlsx’, which is created in sheet1 of the excel file First.xlsx. This file is located in the ‘E drive’ of the computer.\n2. Defining parameters for Line chart:\nvar = df.groupby('BMI').Sales.sum()\nfig = plt.figure()\nax1 = fig.add_subplot(1,1,1)\nax1.set_xlabel('BMI')\nax1.set_ylabel('Sum of Sales')\nax1.set_title(\"BMI wise Sum of Sales\")\nvar.plot(kind='line')\nHere is the output:\n(image source: analyticsvidhya.com)\n4. Create games with Python\nWith Python, you can create a variety of adventure games, arcade games, and puzzle games. You can develop classics games on Python including ping-pong, tic-tac-toe, hangman and more. Pygame is a most popular Python library for game development. Pygame includes various modules with several functionalities for playing sound, drawing graphics, handling mouse input and more.\nSome key points about Pygame (Python’s library)\nIt is an open-source library that is available for free to build games in Python.\nIt is highly portable and can be run on any operating system, including Windows, macOS, etc.\nIt is one of the most powerful Python libraries that contains almost everything you need to get started with building your own games.\nIt contains a wide range of modules that can be used to add interactive features or functionalities to your existing application.\nWe know that every language has certain advantages and limitations. Now the question is: is Python good enough for developing every type of game?\nIs Python suitable for developing every type of game applications?\nThere are many programming languages, including Python, Java, etc., that are suitable for developing game applications. However, Python is not good for developing performance-intensive games, meaning the games that require extremely fast action. Also, Python can be used to build powerful 2D games, but building 3D games in Python will not give the expected high performance and output. For building 3D games, there are other programming languages available on the market, like: C, C#, C++, Java, etc.\nHowever, game developers can use Python for building tools to simplify routine tasks related to games, such as level designing. Python is good for number crunching and string manipulations, it also has an extensive library. This, in turn, makes it suitable for building tool kits for games in order to automate repetitive tasks.\n5. Building robotics applications\nAccording to the Global Market Insights report, “The worldwide industrial robotics market size is set to exceed $80 billion by 2024.” And, a huge portion of the robotics growth is contributed by artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is a field of robotics that is used to control robots. We have already discussed why Python is the most popular programming language in the field of AI. Now, let's understand why Python is the most suitable language for robotics:\nWhy Python for robotics?\nRobotics operating systems are compatible with Python.\nIt has a ton of computational libraries that are required for robotics.\nIt is a simple language that even non-programmers (with deep knowledge in robotics technology) can learn, understand and use effectively while building robotics applications.\nPython and Raspberry Pi\nPython programming language is used to build Raspberry Pi. Raspberry Pi is a small-sized computer that can be plugged into TVs or computer monitors. You can also use Raspberry Pi to build and control robots.\nSome key points about Raspberry Pi\nIts latest model is Raspberry Pi 4 Model B.\nIt comes with a Raspberry official beginners’ guide, with which you can learn how to set up, configure and use the Raspberry Pi computer.\nNeed help building amazing applications, partner with a python development company to help?

    "extractedText": "PYTHON\n7 Important Reasons Why You Should Use Python\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n1 SEP 2019 • 8 MIN READ\nPython is a powerful and high-level programming language that lets you develop a wide variety of applications, including web applications, software and game development, network programming, graphical user interfaces (GUIs), scientific and numeric applications and more. According to Cuong Do, Software Architect of YouTube, “ Python allows us to produce maintainable features in record times, with a minimum of developers”. There are many success stories with Python, showing that this programming language is helping numerous enterprises in achieving their business goals.\nAccording to PYPL Index and TIOBE Index, Python is the most popular programming language in 2019. PYPL has placed Python in the first position and TIOBE has placed Python in 3rd position in terms of popularity among developers and enterprises.\nWhy you should use Python\nIn this article, we have listed some key points that will help you understand the benefits of Python over other programming languages. To understand why you should use Python, read the following:\n1. Code is easy to read, use and maintain\nThe effectiveness of the application greatly depends on the quality of its source code.\nA robust application needs a powerful programming language that is easy to read, update and maintain. Python incorporates all these qualities. It offers everything (including a set of huge libraries and utilities) that are needed to build amazing applications, utilities and frameworks.\nSome major benefits that Python offers to the developers and the organization:\nPython has a clean and structured code base, making the updating and maintenance tasks of the software easier for developers. They don’t require developers to write additional code, and this, in turn, saves them effort and valuable time. Hence, they can utilize their time on something more productive for the organization.\nThe syntax rule of Python is composed mainly of English keywords, emphasizing the code readability. Code readability plays a major role while building the application. Customers' requirements can change when the software gets to employed in the real-world. With Python, you don’t need to worry about the changing requirements. Even if developers who have previously built the application have left the organization, the new developers can easily read and understand the original version of the code and implement the new requirements accordingly.\n2. Supports multiple programming paradigms\nPython is constructed with the aim to help developers write logical and clean code for both large-scale and small-scale projects.\nAn important feature that makes Python suitable for large and complex applications is it supports multiple programming paradigms (meaning ways to classify programming languages on the basis of their features).\nIt supports the following programming paradigms:\nProcedural programming: It is based on the pattern or procedures that consist of any series of computational steps. Its main objective is to focus on the program's goal, then identify the problems and break them into smaller and more manageable components (called modules) in order to solve the main goal. In this, the program is planned out in a storyboard style.\nObject-oriented programming: It is based on the concept of object and class. In simple words, objects and classes are the sets of data that contains fields, variable data types, etc., in the form of code. Object-oriented programming initiates with planning and diagramming the program. Then objects and classes are constructed, functions are built and data fields are placed, beginning to take the development environment.\nFunctional programming: In functional programming, developers try to bind everything in pure mathematical computational style. It involves the evaluation of complex expressions. In this, programmers mainly focus on the desired result, not on how to solve or compute it.\nIt is an undeniable fact that one programming paradigm cannot solve all problems efficiently. The support of these multi programming paradigms (procedural, object-oriented and functional programming) makes Python a popular programming language among enterprises. It also features automatic memory management that makes it even more powerful than other programming languages in the market.\n3) Compatible with Major Platforms and Systems\nPython supports all the major operating systems and architectures. Let’s have a look:\nWith this support of operating systems and architectures, Python code can be run on any of these platforms. Being an interpreted programming language, Python’s code is executed line-by-line directly without a prerequisite to compile the human-written code into machine instructions first. This is in contrast with compiled programming languages, such as C, C++, Java, etc. Compiled programming languages are those in which a compiler converts the human-written code into machine instructions all at once, instead of line-by-line and then the execution of code takes place.\nBeing an interpreted language, Python offers the following benefits over compiled programming languages such as C, C++, Java, etc:\nIt is easier to run the same Python program on multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, macOS, etc. You just need to make sure that Python is installed on the computer where you are running the code. Whereas in compiled programming languages such as C, C++, and Java, we cannot copy the compiled program from the Linux computer to the Windows computer and expect the program to run successfully. Unlike interpreted languages (like Python), in compiled programming languages, we need to recompile the program again on the Windows computer in order to run the same program successfully on a different operating system.\nSince Python code is executed line-by-line, instead of all at once, it is easy to make alterations in the code and run the modified code and see the impact of changes immediately in the result. This makes Python suitable for ad-hoc requests without increasing the development time. Whereas, with compiled programming languages, making changes is not as easy as in Python. You need to recompile and redeploy the program after making changes.\n4. Large standard library\nPython has a robust and large standard library that makes it stand out from other programming languages. Its standard library contains a wide range of modules, operations and web service tools that you can select and use for your applications without writing additional code.\nBenefits Python offers with its huge standard library:\nThe standard library provides low-level details to developers, therefore, developers can focus on the logic of the application rather than looking for low-level details for the apps.\nSince most developers are familiar with the standard library,the code provided by Python’s standard library is more maintainable and can easily be reused across the projects. This enables the new developers joining the organization to easily understand the on-going projects, shortening their learning curve.\nPython’s standard library is well-optimized and tested, proving you the reliable and effective code for your application.\n5. Cost-effective approach\nPython is an open-source programming language, meaning no licensing fees are required to use it. This makes Python the most reasonable and affordable choice for enterprises.\nIt offers various open-source frameworks, development tools, and libraries that significantly reduce the development cost and development time.\nExamples of open-source Python frameworks and toolkits:\n6. Simplifies the complexities of software development\nPython is designed to build a wide variety of application domains, including web-based applications, desktop applications, complex scientific and numeric applications and more. It is built with features to facilitate data visualization (generating graphical representation of data to perform data analytics) and data analysis (the process of analysis, cleansing, sorting and modeling data to extract meaningful insights). It provides various APIs and data visualization libraries that enable engineers to represent data in a more effective and appealing way. This is why many Business Intelligence (BI) and data science tools use Python as their programming language. It can be used to create custom big data solutions without requiring you to invest extra effort and time. Python can also be used to carry out certain tasks related to other technologies as well, such as Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence (AI).\n7. Adoption of Test-Driven Development\nPython supports the test-driven development approach. Before proceeding further, you should know what a test-driven approach means and how it is better from the traditional testing method:\nWhat is a test-driven development (TDD) approach?\nTest-driven development: from this term only it is clear that TDD lets you test drive your design and development of the application. It means building tests that will specify and validate what the code will do, what will be the next step, what the design is, etc.\nTDD mainly involves the following phases:\nWrite the test cases before the development phase (when developers start coding for an application).\nWrite the code so that it can pass the test cases.\nIf any error encountered in the code while testing, then make modifications to the code.\nRun the code again to pass the test cases.\nIf code passes the test cases, then stop; otherwise, repeat step 3.\nHow is TDD better than traditional testing methodology?\nIn the traditional testing method, test cases are developed and implemented after writing the code. This impacts the speed of product delivery. Whereas, in TDD, test cases are developed and implemented before writing the code. If the test case fails, then developers have to write or modify only that minimum amount of code to pass that test case. This, in turn, avoids the duplication of code, makes the code simpler, cleaner and bug-free.\nUnlike a traditional testing method, TDD ensures 100% test coverage. No single line of code is left untested, delivering an accurate and error-free application.\nNow, coming back to Python support for TDD, Python makes it easy for the development team to perform coding and testing simultaneously by adopting TDD methodology. It helps in shortening the development and testing cycle and reducing the time-to-market for your product.\nContact us if you need help building your application in Python. At Zibtek, our team of dedicated engineers can build a robust, flexible and scalable application using Python.\nWhat are some characteristics of Python that make it a popular choice among programming languages?\nPython is a popular choice among programming languages due to its simplicity and readability, a large and active community, a wealth of libraries and frameworks, support for multiple programming paradigms, and its use in scientific computing and data analysis. These characteristics make Python easy to learn and use, and allow it to be applied to a wide range of projects.\nIs Python used in industry?\nYes, Python is widely used in industry for a variety of tasks, including web development, data analytics, and Machine Learning. It is also used by companies such as Google, Netflix, and Instagram\nHow does Python compare to other programming languages?\nPython is often compared to other high-level languages such as Swift, JavaScript, and C#. It is generally considered to be easier to learn and use than these languages, as it has a more concise syntax and a more intuitive object-oriented design. It is also dynamically typed, which means that you don't need to specify the data type of a variable when you declare it, which can make it easier to write code.\nPartnering with a company that offers cost-effective Python development outsourcing can help you accelerate your project timeline.

    "extractedText": "A Beginners Guide to the Many Types of Software Development\nJake Barthelmy\nCustom software development with Zibtek’s Product Insights Blog. Discover tips, trends, and strategies for successful product development.\nMore posts by Jake Barthelmy.\nJAKE BARTHELMY\n16 AUG 2022 • 4 MIN READ\nA well-managed software development project ensures a successful launch. Managing a project efficiently requires choosing the best methodology from the many types of software development that exist.\nAll software development methodologies have different strengths and weaknesses, and each requires specific skills and mindsets. Choose the wrong one, and your project, like so many others before it, might fail. Work with a developer with detailed knowledge of each type, and your chances of building a product that supports your tech goals increase accordingly. Also with all methods it can be really helpful to build a POC first. To learn more about POC's check out this article about how POC's can help mitigate risk.\nHere’s a look at the most frequently used type of software development. Depending on your project, you might require just one, but many projects often rely on a hybrid approach.\nTypes of Software Development\nChoosing the proper software development methodology is critical to enhancing project control, setting predictable delivery dates, and meeting product goals. Which one you select is typically determined by team size, goals, and other factors.\nFront-end and Back-end Development\nThe “front end” is the client-side of a product, and it plays a significant role in nearly every type of software development. Front-end developer tasks include fixing bugs and ensuring the user interface runs on multiple browsers. Back-end development comprises server-side behavior and refers to all the machinations that go on “backstage,” including product features end-users don’t see. Back-end development drives software development as a whole, ensuring strong software performance, security, and scalability.\nFull Stack Development\nBack-end and front-end developers collaborate to deliver a product that users love and won’t “fall apart” in the process. A full-stack development process makes for more comprehensive software development overall and can reduce hiring costs.\nAPI Development\nAPI or Application Programming Interface development lets developers extend software beyond traditional boundaries. APIs are critical pieces of the development puzzle, as they provide a platform for the software to interact with other software. For instance, without API integration, you wouldn’t be able to share the latest crisis on social media, check the current weather, or instantly open up a map when you search for an address. Needless to say, APIs are an essential asset in every type of software development from here on.\nEmbedded Systems Development\nPhotography buffs probably don’t think of their digital cameras as an example of software development, but they are. Developers build embedded systems into digital cameras that allow them to extend dedicated functionalities like storing photos. Cars, manufacturing machinery, traffic control systems, and medical imaging equipment all have embedded software-based functions. As the Internet of Things (IoT) soars in popularity and use, embedded systems development is keeping pace, creating code to control various devices that aren’t your traditional computer.\nDatabase Development\nIt takes a lot of experience and effort to design and develop a company’s data operations. Database development is a sophisticated process of developing and analyzing objectives and requirements in the form of raw data. It makes it possible to handle large chunks of data more effectively and makes it easy to find information quickly.\nCloud Computing\nDevelopers use languages like Java, JS (Node JS), Python, and more to create cloud storage applications similar to DropBox, OneDrive, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Cloud development is the process of developing web solutions or apps that can be run over the cloud, making them easily accessible from nearly any location, provided a user has an internet connection.\nIoT Software Engineering\nInternet of Things software development is the methodical development of IoT infrastructure using a combination of software and hardware solutions and deals with data collected via processes and sensors. It’s commonly used in applications for smart cities and power grids, construction, and telehealth services.\nIoT devices allow enterprises to automate business operations, including daily activities, with the integration of mobile phones, smartwatches, laptops, and sensors making effective communication possible.\nAI and Machine Learning in Software Development\nThe primary difference between machine learning and AI in software development is that AI enables systems to replicate human behavior and machine learning allows a machine to learn human behavior and make improvements.\nBoth help software development by automating processes, reducing the time and costs involved, and achieving 100% accuracy. Their effect on the software development process is four-fold:\nProject planning. Accuracy of the project planning stage is improved, ensuring technical effectiveness and economic efficiency.\nProblem analysis. Work is completed faster and with greater accuracy.\nProject management. AI calculates the budget, implication of changes to scope and timeline, and performs risk modeling.\nQuality analysis. AI enables developers to code better and identify and fix bugs, while machine-learning algorithms improve testing.\nDevOps Application Development\nDevOps development focuses on the quick, efficient, and customer-centric delivery of software. It combines development and operations to increase the security of software development and delivery compared to more traditional processes. Encompassing automation, collaboration, iterative improvement, and rapid feedback, DevOps’ more nimble lifecycle gives businesses a competitive advantage.\nWant to learn more about the different types of software development available for your next project?

    "extractedText": "Software Development Methodologies: An In-Depth Look at The Top 6\nVedant Vyas\nRead more posts by this author.\nVEDANT VYAS\n1 NOV 2021 • 3 MIN READ\nWhile a lot of software development methodologies focus on agile and waterfall, there are more methods to choose from than you might think—nearly 60 at last count! Each has its loyal adherents, with different approaches having the fastest speed, highest quality, and lowest total cost of ownership.\nDepending on needs, budget, and desired launch date, software developers in the U.S. tend to choose one of seven to ten software development methodologies. In an earlier post, we gave you an overview of some of the most popular ones they use. Here, we’ll dive a little deeper into why you might want to choose one type of software development over another for your next project, and we’ll take a look at a couple of approaches we didn’t include last time.\nA Closer Look at Top Software Development Methodologies\nThe steps involved in choosing the proper software development methodology are based on project needs and the benefits it provides from making a particular choice. Though there’s no “perfect” approach to software development, you can use specific criteria to narrow your choice, including:\nProject focus and complexity\nCustomer and stakeholder involvement\nFlexibility of timeline\nAllotted budget\nNumber and type of teams working on the project\nRequired resources vs. available resources\nProject scalability\nResistance to change and rigidity of structure\nSpecialization of roles\nSet start and end dates\nNow on to the methodologies.\n6. Feature-Driven Development\nLike agile, feature-driven development is an iterative, incremental, and customer-centric approach to software development. It encourages status reporting at all levels, which helps developers to update the project regularly, identify errors quickly, and provide clients with progress reports and results at any time. A practical approach, it’s ideal for long-term, complex projects and is often a good option for teams that want a structured, focused agile methodology that can be easily scaled across the product organization.\n5. Scrum Development\nThe leading agile methodology, Scrum is ideal when you’re looking for quick feedback, better communication, and optimal flexibility. Reasons to choose the Scrum methodology include when:\nRequirements aren’t clearly defined.\nThere’s a high probability of changes during development.\nEarly and frequent testing is needed.\nThe product owner is fully available.\nThe development team has self-management skills.\nThe client’s culture is open to innovation and adaptable to change.\n4. Full Stack Development\nIf there’s an ideal time for using full stack development, it’s when you want to take an idea or feature and turn it into a fully functional prototype. Because full stack developers understand business requirements and engineering capabilities, they make excellent product managers who are skilled in taking all parameters into account when making decisions. Full stack development is also the ideal choice when your budget doesn’t allow for hiring a specialist for each layer of the development process.\n3. Extreme Programming\nAnother agile project management methodology, extreme programming was created to dramatically reduce the software development lifecycle. More than just a series of steps to manage projects, it follows a set of values that helps teams work faster and collaborate more effectively. If you’re looking to quickly release and respond to customer requests, extreme programming can be the perfect fit for your project.\n2. Lean Development\nIf you want a methodology that is both iterative and waste-averse, lean development is the way to go, as it’s all about paring things down both process and delivery-wise. It’s a good choice for addressing risks quickly and cheaply and has a high focus on market validation and making a successful product, not the “right” product. In the hands of high-caliber developers, lean empowers team members to speak up when they have a new idea, which can greatly improve engagement.\n1. Embedded Systems Development\nYes, you can develop embedded software using agile methodology. As embedded software actually requires many of the same processes and ideas used in traditional software development, it’s also amenable to agile methodologies. But it does require rethinking both processes as one iterative, continuous process to address challenges like coupling the agile methodology to hardware development.\nTo learn more about software development methodologies and how Zibtek’s process helps your business successfully develop custom software, get in touch with us today.

    "extractedText": "SOFTWARE OUTSOURCING\nWhy should you consider outsourcing your software development?\nVedant Vyas\nRead more posts by this author.\nVEDANT VYAS\n25 FEB 2021 • 6 MIN READ\nGone are the days when the only way companies could get any meaningful software development work done was through an in-house development team. Lots of companies may have software development work that only needs to be accomplished once. So they can’t justify the cost of maintaining a full in-house development team.\nThis dilemma has given birth to a completely separate industry. Software outsourcing has now become the norm even for big conglomerates that routinely require development work. It has leveled the playing field for companies of all sizes, thereby improving access to technology for consumers.\nThe cost savings that it provides as opposed to hiring a full internal development team are immense. It also enables companies to move quickly and scale up their software services as and when required. Furthermore, they can do all of that without losing much of their time in managing developers themselves.\nWhat is outsourced software development?\nThe simplest definition of outsourced software development is that when a third-party service provider is hired to handle all aspects of software development, it’s called outsourcing. Some companies choose to outsource certain parts of their project while others outsource entire projects.\nIt’s a very modular approach to software development, not to mention that it’s also very cost-effective. Companies that have their internal teams can choose to outsource sections of the project if they need to speed up the work. Those that don’t have internal teams can outsource all of the work to a third-party.\nThis means that even a one-person operation can have a full-fledged software suite because all of the work is done by professionals that are contracted for the job. That one-person business can thus compete in the market with more established competitors that may have dedicated development teams.\nYou may need to outsource development work for software that only your employees use. For example, you can hire a service provider to create inventory tracking software for your warehouse. It’s not something that your clients will ever use but it will help improve efficiency overall.\nIf you’re a family-owned restaurant, you might want to get an app developed that lets your customers order ahead of time or simply check out your menu and the latest deals. Either way, after outsourcing the work, the business owner has their hands free to deal with more pressing matters.\nShould I outsource my software development?\nThere are several aspects that business owners should consider when deciding whether or not they should outsource their software development. For many, it’s a matter of time versus money.\nEven if they have the skills, would they rather spend the time it would take to develop the software themselves or outsource the job and spend that time better on pursuing big picture items for their business?\nAdvantages\nCost savings\nOne of the primary advantages of outsourcing software development is the money that it can save businesses. Hiring an internal development team is expensive, particularly if there’s no ongoing need. Simply outsourcing the work will always be cheaper.\nWork with professionals\nSoftware development is a complex field so even if you have some knowledge, there may be languages or frameworks that you’re not familiar with. If they need to be utilized in the software that you require for your business, it’s always better to work with professionals rather than trying to wing it yourself.\nThis will ensure the quality of work and it needs to be a major consideration particularly if the software you need developing is going to be client-facing. You wouldn’t want to offer customers something that gives them a bad experience.\nHigher product quality\nEnsuring a high product quality should be at the forefront for business owners. That’s how they will retain customers and effectively compete against rivals. This is why outsourcing the development work to professionals that can deliver a quality product is so important.\nDisadvantages\nCommunication barriers\nThis is often a pitfall that business owners face when they outsource software development. That's particularly of concern when the work is outsourced to an offshore development first. They may not speak the same first language, there may be time zone differences to take into account, and perhaps even cultural conventions.\nEffective communication is perhaps the most important aspect of outsourcing. If that can't be ensured, there's no guarantee that the project will progress as per requirements. That can lead to a waste of both time and resources.\nLack of clarity on project’s scope\nHow do you ensure that the firm you have outsourced the development to completely understands the project’s scope? Properly explaining that to them is as much your responsibility as it is there to be mindful of the project’s requirements.\nHowever, these issues are often seen in outsourced jobs. Misalignment on the vision for the project can be fatal to the entire exercise and in many cases, the work has to be started from scratch. That's an outcome best avoided.\nPrivacy issues\nYour company may be required to meet data privacy regulations in its local jurisdiction, but would those same regulations apply to an offshore company that’s handling your development work? Are they able to access the personal data of your users or whether there’s any potential of that data being misused?\nThese privacy issues need to be kept in mind when outsourcing the job, particularly to a different jurisdiction. Any lapse in compliance could end up being very costly for your company and if adequate protections aren’t in place as far as your contract with the third-party developer is concerned, then your company may be on the hook for any potential liability.\nHow much does it cost to outsource software development?\nHow much it costs to outsource software development can vary significantly based on several factors. The service provider's location is one of the biggest factors. Developers in markets like the United States or Europe are understandably going to be more expensive compared to developers in locations like India.\nDevelopers in those markets can often be tantalizingly cost-effective with rates starting at $10 per hour but even highly experienced professionals there can charge upwards of $50 per hour, that's around the same you'd expect to pay for a young professional in North America.\nThe nature of the project also has an impact on its cost. Is the work you require able to be done by one developer or will it require an entire team? In most cases, simple apps, software, websites, etc can be made by one developer.\nAn entire team may be required for more complex projects, especially if they require ongoing maintenance or regular updates. The cost would then be exponentially higher compared to a job that a single person can accomplish.\nA good rule of thumb to keep in mind when estimating how much it would cost to outsource development is that the bigger the project, the more expensive it’s going to be.\nHow do you successfully outsource software development?\nProject management tools are your friend. Use them so that developers are reminded of the tasks that are assigned to them. Since there are many different tasks related to a single project, it's always possible for them to miss something. A project management tool ensures that the work is done systematically and that nothing falls through the cracks.\nAdopting agile methodologies is always a good idea. This way, the business can keep an eye on the progress during the project's life cycle. Both the client and the developer can work in line with the technical and business aspects of the project. This leads to a greater understanding of the project for all parties involved.\nBeing obsessive about UX design helps too. The software you get created shouldn't only look good but it should be functional as well. Poor UX is going to significantly degrade the user experience which would make user retention difficult. It's imperative to work with a development partner that understands the importance of good UX design.\nGet help from a reputable developer\nIt’s always best to entrust a reputable developer with your project. Zibtek has long been a trusted outsourcing partner for Fortune 500 companies and startups alike. We have helped them with both complex and simple projects, enabling them to bring their vision to reality.\nZibtek has offices in Salt Lake City, Utah with a team of highly skilled software development professionals.

Unlike long-running feature branches that frequently create complex code merges when features are ready to be integrated into the main branch, feature flags allow us to quickly and easily deploy small pieces to a limited group who can check them before they’re deployed to the whole user base.\nA simple yet powerful tool, feature flags are truly a revolutionary part of the build process.\nFeature Flags vs. Other Processes\nHow do feature flags differ from other software delivery processes like pull requests and long-running branches?\nOften used as a default process, the biggest drawback to branches is how long they tend to live. Multiple short-living branches, as good intentioned as they may be, often impede delivery performance.\nLikewise, when pull requests go unhandled for too long, aka a few days, they can quickly “gather dust.”\nUnlike feature flags, both of these processes prevent teams from:\nDelivering quickly, often, and in small batches.\nRemoving bottlenecks, blockages, and all the other stuff that causes delays.\nGetting timely feedback.\nFeature flags, on the other hand, let us deploy smaller features that turn on and off for specific groups. We’re able to get the smallest amount of code into the trunk as quickly as possible, which allows for better testing and less breakage.\nHow Feature Flags Work\nSometimes called feature toggles or feature switches, feature flags turn certain functionalities on and off during runtime, and they do it without deploying new code. This brings a lot of value to the process by allowing us to:\nMake changes in a low-risk scenario.\nShift tiny pieces of code while stable code remains in place.\nTest small things like buttons that don’t work with live data.\nHave more controlled experimentation over a feature's lifecycle.\nChoose when and to which users new code is delivered.\nTo validate feature functionality, teams can also use feature flags to perform soft launches or rollouts of new product features.\nHow Feature Flags can be used in an Agile environment?\nHere are a few practical examples of how feature flags can be used in an Agile environment.\nProduct testing. Smaller footprints are always more testable. Feature flags are used to progressively release new product features to determine if they’re worth the investment return. A partial idea or new product feature can be deployed to a small group of users to gather feedback. If it’s enthusiastically endorsed, it can be rolled out to a larger user base. If it’s a flop? The feature flag can be disabled and removed later from the code base.\nMigrations. Feature flags allow teams to safely migrate or update databases. While no database migration is easy, feature flags make it easier to test it with real, live data and much easier to roll it back if something goes wrong.\nExperiment feature flags allow you to perform A/B tests against a deployed feature. If the feature being tested is a winner, you can change that feature to a feature rollout. If the results are less than anticipated, the flag can be removed.\nCanary launches allow you to gradually release new features while simultaneously testing other features without making major deployments. With a canary launch, you can assess things like whether users are happier and if a new feature increases system load.At Zibtek, we like using feature flags as often as possible. They allow for continuous deployment and add safety to the process by putting a “kill” switch on each new feature.

    "extractedText": "How to Choose Web Application Development Software\nVedant Vyas\nRead more posts by this author.\nVEDANT VYAS\n20 JUL 2021 • 3 MIN READ\nWeb application development software helps developers work with a variety of technologies, providing faster development at lower costs. Which development platform you choose to build your web application has a far-reaching impact, as it’s the backbone of your application. This post covers several considerations for making an informed decision.\nHow Web Application Development Software Works\nWeb applications utilize web browsers and web technology to perform tasks over the internet. They allow for better communication between businesses and their customers. They’ve become such a common part of modern life, yet few people even realize they’re using one. The simplest example of a web app is a contact form on a website. Other examples include web apps that let employees collaborate and work on shared documents. Spreadsheets, video and photo editing, and file conversion are web applications, too.\nMost web apps have short development cycles and can often be created by small teams. An Agile approach to web application development focuses on the collaboration of all stakeholders and provides a better procedure for revisions and progression of web application requirements. The Agile methodology includes research, analysis, design, programming, project management, frequent testing, implementation, adaptation, and maintenance.\nDifferent Types of Web Application Development Software\nUntil the 1990s, web applications were relatively simple and mainly used by academic and technology groups. Today, they’re much more sophisticated and offer many benefits as they:\nRequire less support and maintenance and have lower tech requirements.\nReduce costs for end-users and businesses.\nAlways up-to-date.\nAre equally accessible by all users, which eliminates compatibility issues.\nCan be run on multiple platforms regardless of operating system or device.\nZibtek’s developers are skilled in working with numerous web application development software solutions to build web applications.\nRuby on Rails\nRuby is a dynamic, general-purpose interpreted language that resembles English. Rails is the web development framework designed to make creating new software in Ruby less tedious. It helps developers quickly build websites of any complexity and is suitable for a broad range of programming tasks. It’s often used for projects like eCommerce, social networks, SaaS solutions, and informational portals.\nAngularJS\nAngularJS is an open-source structural framework for dynamic web apps. When you use HTML as your template language, Angular lets you extend HTML’s syntax to express an application’s components succinctly and clearly. The framework’s data binding and dependency injection help eliminate a great deal of the code you’d otherwise need to write. Its main objective is to help you develop single-page applications. It emphasizes code quality and testability and is used by major players like PayPal, Amazon, Netflix, and more.\nReact\nFacebook developed React in 2011 for its own use in creating components for web applications. Today, it is an open-source solution used by many Fortune 500 companies who value its flexibility, support resources, great performance, and easy testing. As it’s easy to learn, it delivers a great developer experience.\nHow to Choose Web Application Development Software\nJavaScript-friendly frameworks like Ruby, React, and Angular help developers build web applications with dynamic front ends and solid back ends. They are some of the leading web technologies in the world today and are instrumental in building many amazing web apps.\nWhen selecting the right web app development platform for your project, it’s essential to pick one that helps you avoid typical developer stumbling blocks.\nFramework expertise. Developers must have extensive knowledge of any software so they can use it to its maximum potential.\nUser experience. It’s not uncommon for developers to focus too much on coding while ignoring UX/UI. It’s essential to use a platform that strikes the perfect balance between user experience and coding complexity.\nSecurity. Web application cyberattacks rose by 800% in just the first half of 2020. Be sure to choose software that meets current security standards.\nScalability. Any web application software you choose should be able to match a company’s growth without compromising speed and performance.\nTo ensure you make the right choice, clearly identify the goals you’re trying to achieve and find the right team with the experience and expertise needed to take your web application development to the next level.\nZibtek’s talented web developers dedicate themselves to the highest quality engineering. With their gorgeous designs, cutting-edge code, and exceptional usability, we like to say our web apps are the perfect combination of beauty and brains.

    "extractedText": "How to Develop a Web Application: Your 10-Step Guide\nVedant Vyas\nRead more posts by this author.\nVEDANT VYAS\n21 OCT 2021 • 6 MIN READ\nLearning how to develop a web application isn’t as difficult as you might think. When the idea of web applications was introduced back in 1999, each app had to be separately installed on each user’s personal computer. Today, web applications are supported by various web browsers and can work on any operating system. But what’s remained the same is how beneficial they are for those who use them.\nAs web apps have become an integral part of life, they often go unnoticed unless, of course, they’re poorly developed. An experienced web app development consultancy like Zibtek can work with you to develop intuitive, custom web applications that simply your day-to-day operations and your customers’ lives.\nThe 5 Stages of Web Application Development\nThe web application development life cycle has five phases:\nPlanning\nAnalysis\nDesign and Development\nTesting\nLaunch or implementation and maintenance.\nFollowing this methodology ensures project consistency and completeness and an end product that provides the solution you’re looking for.\nHow To Develop a Web Application\nCalling, messaging, gaming, checking bank balances, and ordering a pizza. What would life be without web apps? Businesses, too, rely on web apps for everything from marketing their business to conducting workplace drug and alcohol screenings.\nSo if you're wondering how to develop a web application, it's important to consider what your app is going to be used for once it's developed. While each web app serves a unique purpose, the development process remains consistent across the board.\nStep 1: Identify the web app’s purpose\nThe best web apps spring from real-life problems that need better solutions. Not every web application needs to be a breakthrough phenomenon. But your web app should offer a significant, measurable improvement over other apps. Ask yourself:\nWhat will people use this app for?\nHow will it make life easier for them?\nWhat solutions does it offer that other apps don’t?\nStep 2: Conduct market research\nIt’s easy to get caught up in the design and development of the actual app, but if you hope to implement a successful road map, it’s essential to frequently check in with actual users. In the early stages, you’ll need to focus on higher-level problems in order to fully understand all the challenges the end-user faces. As app development progresses, challenges become more granular and narrower. For instance, is a lack of documentation making it more difficult to adopt features? Is an API deficiency reducing efficiency?\nStep 3: Define functionality\nThe better you can define what constitutes good functionality, the more users will prefer and use your web application. For example, if you want to develop a web app that streamlines the customer’s buying experience, you might want to focus on building better comparison and checkout experiences. The goal is to design an app that leaves a positive impression with the user.\nStep 4: Sketch the web app\nFor this step, some people use paper and pencil. Others like web apps like Google Docs. Whichever you prefer, now’s the time to map out your application’s layout which includes text, image, and button placement, as well as other interactive components. Your design should be orderly and flow intuitively. Be sure to refer back to your market research to ensure you’re answering users’ specific desires. If you prefer to find help with the design aspect, here's an excellent source for you.\nStep 5: Plan the workflow\nAs part of the planning stage, the development team prepares an action plan, taking into account the time and specialists needed to implement the project. An initial meeting is held to discuss everything from further work to communication rules and project management. Zibtek’s practical Agile approach relies on sprints, which are small, targeted allotments of development time that allow our engineers to solve problems more collaboratively. Sprints are ideal for more easily incorporating new ideas, improving project predictability, and delivering a superior product.\nStep 6: Wireframe the UI and seek early validation\nA visually compelling user experience is critical to web app adoption. Think of wireframes as sketches that tell you exactly how your web application’s pages will look. It’s often best to build a basic prototype to start and then build on it as testing and feedback are conducted. Alpha and beta testing of your prototype help improve your web app, make it more user-friendly, and give you a strong foundation for a more successful development process.\nStep 7: Architect the database\nA web app’s architecture simply describes the interactions between applications, databases, and middleware systems on the web. Database architecture uses various programming languages to design a particular type of application. Which one is used for your app depends on, among other things, time, budget, and functionality considerations. Most web apps use SQL or document databases.\nStep 8: Build the front-end\nThe front-end of your web app is its visual elements, defining what users see and interact with. Developers use web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create visually appealing applications that users find easy to read and navigate.\nStep 9: Build the back-end\nBack-end development is the server-side logic that powers your app from “behind the scenes.” It includes all the code necessary for build out the database, server, and application.\nStep 10: Launch your web app\nOnce you choose a hosting platform that provides exceptional page load speeds and uptimes, your web app is ready for launch!\nAs an essential tool for businesses large and small, web apps offer improved efficiency, 24/7 accessibility, and higher security levels. At Zibtek, we develop and build custom web applications more quickly and at a lower cost than you might have thought possible. To learn more or to talk with one of our experts, get in touch with us today.\nWhat are the steps to build a web application?\nFirst is to conceptualise the product. Then, second, is the discovery / design phase. Third is the development phase. Fourth, you launch the application. And then fifth and finally is ongoing maintenance and support.\nHow to develop a web application?\nIn order to build a web application, you must have a clear idea of the goals for the application. Once the goals of the application are clearly defined, you will now want to hire or contract a development team to put together a technical plan to build the application in the most efficient way to accomplish the goals you have outlined. It is important that you are always clear on the goals of the application and allow the development team to determine how the application will be built.\nWhat is the first stage of web application development?\nThe first stage of web application development is discovery. In discovery, the product team will work with the development team to outline the deliverables of the project, decide a technology stack, create wireframes / designs, define the architecture of the application, and finalize a timeline of completion with milestones.

    "extractedText": "Is There a Best Language for AI?\nVedant Vyas\nRead more posts by this author.\nVEDANT VYAS\n9 MAR 2022 • 4 MIN READ\nDetermining the best language for AI before you start on your next software project will make the project go a lot smoother. Today, artificial intelligence is an integral part of the technologies people use every day. As the need for AI-powered software and apps grows, so too does the need for AI developers. Like all things related to software development, how to best create AI-based software and applications depends on multiple factors.\nIn this post, we take a look at whether software developers agree on the best language for AI and how choosing an AI programming language ultimately comes down to your project's scope and requirements.\nBest Language for AI\nAI allows organizations big and small to save time and money by automating and optimizing routine business processes. Recent research suggests that a growing number of companies are using AI for multiple core business practices, including enhancing workforce and customer experiences.\nAI is not a specific, one-size-fits-all solution. For instance:\nIf your project involves extensive data analysis, you might want to choose R, as it’s aimed at statistical computing.\nIf you want a language best-suited for deploying machine-learning models in production, Python’s your better pick.\nJava is a popular choice for mobile app development, which relies heavily on AI.\nLet’s explore the advantages and diverse applications of the most popular AI programming languages.\n1. Python\nUsed for a wide range of applications, including back-end development and machine learning, Python streamlines coding and makes the language easier to learn. Versatile and simple to use, this highly-popular language is an excellent choice for new and seasoned AI development engineers regardless of programming experience. Developers love its straightforward structure, exceptional documentation, and community support, as well as its broad range of pre-designed libraries that optimize the AI development process.\nAI-specific frameworks developed for Python include:\nscikit-learn for training machine learning models.\nPyTorch for visual and natural language processing.\nKeras, which serves as a code interface for complex mathematical calculations.\nTheano, a library for defining, optimizing, and evaluating mathematical expressions.\n2. Java\nOften considered the go-to language for AI-intensive mobile app development, Java is one of the best languages for AI. It offers a simple syntax, easy debugging, quicker execution and faster runtimes compared to Python. It also facilitates easy scaling of large or complex AI applications. Many popular big data processing tools like Apache Hive, Hadoop, and Spark are written in Java, allowing for smooth integration with these key analytic frameworks.\n3. Julia\nIf your software or app requires numerical analysis and computational science, the Julia programming language is worth considering. While relatively new, its speed, powerful computation capacity, and script-like syntax make it a popular choice. It can seamlessly translate algorithms from research papers into code while enabling machine learning engineers to estimate a model and deploy it in production using the same language.\n4. LISP\nLISP or Lisp has a long history—it’s the second-oldest high-level programming language. It dates back to the 1950s when AI pioneer John McCarthy created it for AI programs like ELIZA, an early natural language processing computer program. Thanks to its adaptability, quick prototyping abilities, and capacity for dynamic object creation, it’s typically used in machine learning projects. Over time, many of Lisp’s distinct features have been folded into other popular AI programming languages like Python.\n5. R\nDeveloped by statisticians for statistical computing, R is a powerful, free software environment that easily crunches vast data sets, making it a top programming language for statistical software development, data visualization, and data analysis. It’s also popular for developing machine learning projects that involve model training and evaluation. Its interactive environment is ideal for rapid prototyping and experimentation with new problems.\n6. C++\nA general-purpose programming language now widely used for competitive programming, C++ provides a fast processing speed that facilitates complex machine learning models running with high efficiency. It excels at dynamic load balancing, memory management, and adaptive caching, making it a frequent choice when building scalable big data frameworks. If your AI application is resource-intensive and needs quick execution, C++ is an excellent option.\nBuilding the Best Programming Language for AI\nWhen choosing the “best” AI programming language for your project, it’s essential to:\nKeep in mind your project’s goal and deliverables.\nAssess the tasks at hand.\nIdentify the resources required to complete them.\nOnly then can you move on to considering which AI programming language offers the tools and libraries you need to meet your project’s goals.\nZibtek applies years of experience in software development to help our clients weigh the advantages and limitations afforded by each programming language in the context of what they seek to accomplish. And we do it all with an eye towards optimizing development and reducing overhead costs.\nAre you looking to build an amazing AI app that can transform your business?

Others creep up on us, subtly altering the landscape until one day, we realize the familiar has given way to a brand-new paradigm.\nToday we’re focusing on the “sneaky-bugger” types. You know, the ones that stealthily weave their way into our lives, quietly reshaping our habits and routine, until one day we wake up and realize how we’ve always done things no longer aligns with the universal order. GPS vs. physical maps. Digital vs. film cameras. Encyclopedias vs. search engines.\nConsider UI/UX design services. Few people can pinpoint when we shifted from static to interactive web pages, implemented responsive designs, or integrated gestures and voice interactions. But here we are, breezing through online aisles like we’re at our favorite shopping mall, viewing a website’s identical content on whatever device we choose, and conversing with Siri like she’s one of our closest confidantes.\nIt's been said that “change is inevitable and progress unstoppable.” Facing modern challenges with modern solutions means staying attuned to the industry’s ever-evolving landscape, so your mobile UI/UX design services are up-to-snuff.\nAnd without further ado, we give you our 2024 ultimate guide to mobile UI/UX design services.\nWhat’s Changed for Mobile UI/UX Design Services in 2024?\nThere are multiple areas where traditional solutions for UI/UX design no longer make the cut. Two of the most significant are mobile UI design best practices, and testing & iteration.\nTesting & Iteration\nOne of the most consequential shifts in UI/UX design services is the one from a linear waterfall to an agile methodology. Instead of conducting testing at the end of the development cycle, engineers now use frequent feedback loops and continuous iteration throughout the design process. This iterative methodology allows developers to create and test ideas quickly to improve functionality and usability.\nUser-centric design and usability testing have become core principles in UI/UX design, firmly placing users at the center of the design process. Testing can now involve real users interacting with a prototype or working product to evaluate its effectiveness and identify improvement opportunities.\nUI/UX design services have also become more data-driven, with teams prioritizing collecting and analyzing user data to inform design decisions. At Zibtek, we begin the process with in-depth research to identify the people who will buy and use your product or service and what their expectations are. Surveys, usability tests, and user journey maps provide valuable insights and analytic tools to derive meaningful and substantive data.\nMobile UI UX Design Services: The Ultimate Guide\nMobile UI/UX Design Best Practices\nAdhering to contemporary UI/UX best practices helps create efficient, user-friendly, and trustworthy interfaces that increase engagement and give you the competitive advantage you’re searching for.\nBecause these best practices evolve rapidly, engineers must stay current with the latest industry trends, embrace new technologies, and emphasize a seamlessly intuitive experience across various platforms and devices.\nIn our view, there are eight benchmarks all good mobile UI/UX design must meet:\n1. Is it valuable?\n2. Is it accessible?\n3. Is it desirable?\n4. Is it portable?\n5. Is it findable?\n6. Is it usable?\n7. Is it useful?\n8. Is it credible?\nBut it isn’t enough to tick off these boxes to determine if your design approach will work. Numerous traditional design solutions might meet these criteria, but that doesn’t mean they’re always the best option to address emerging technologies, complex interactions, and user expectations that define the current landscape. You must continually evaluate and adapt your design approach to stay relevant.\nKeeping in mind that best practices come and go as circumstances and technologies change, here are a few we think are helpful in today’s environment:\n· Blend useful and intuitive experiences so users can engage and re-engage at will. Aim to reduce user effort in getting what they want.\n· Keep interfaces light with plenty of breathing room.\n· Eliminate clutter like login walls whenever possible, and break down long forms into multiple pages. How often have you exited an app or site when it immediately requires you to register? Point made.\n· Make navigation simple but engaging enough that users interact with the content.\n· If you’re not already, build for one-handed operation.\n· Keep notifications to a minimum and think twice before sending what users consider annoying messages.\n· Leave app surveys to repeat users who will provide better feedback.\n· Create emotional connections with features like animations and micro-interactions that create a satisfying mood.\nIt’s also worth noting that Google rewards apps that make UX design an integral part of SEO—they expect you to treat those free visitors they’re sending your way as well as possible! So if your app’s experiencing issues like unexpected movement of page content (cumulative layout shift or CLS) or slow loading times due to image rendering time (largest contentful paint or LCP), you will want to get those scores aligned with Google’s guidelines.\nMobile UI UX Design Services: The Ultimate Guide Future Trends in UI/UX Design\nCurrent trends, emerging technologies—particularly those like ChatGPT—and fluid user demands will inform what UI/UX design looks like moving forward. Five intriguing predictions include:\n1. Voice and multimodal interfaces that deliver seamless voice interactions and combine voice, gestures, and visuals.\n2. Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) that immerse users in interactive digital experiences will require designers to master spatial design, intuitive interactions, and 3D visualizations to create captivating and intuitive user experiences.\n3. Accessibility and inclusivity will become increasingly crucial, with designers creating experiences that cater to users with disabilities, ensure regulatory compliance, and incorporate design principles to make digital experiences accessible to everyone.\n4. Personalized, data-driven experiences will become even more customized using tailored interfaces that adapt to individual preferences, contexts, and needs.\n5. Ethical and sustainable design will be embraced as user awareness regarding privacy, data security, and environmental impact grows. Engineers will prioritize privacy-conscious design, implement eco-friendly design strategies, and ensure transparency in data handling to build trust and meet user demands.\nWhat Sets Zibtek’s UI/UX Design Services Apart?\nClient-focused and dedicated to creating user and customer experiences that deliver tangible business results, Zibtek’s UI/UX design services help you navigate today’s digital landscape’s many facets.\nWe’re passionate about innovative design that makes a real difference in the world.

No matter where you’re located, having a website is key to building your brand, reaching your audience, and providing customer support.\nLet’s take a look at how custom web development differs from out-of-the-box templates, and whether or not you should hire a custom web developer to build your site.\nCustom web development, defined\nFirst, what exactly is custom web development? Does it include programming? Coding? Web design? The short answer is that it depends. While there’s some overlap between web developers and web designers, the two specialties are slightly different.\nPhoto by Clément H / Unsplash\nA web designer focuses on the look and feel of your website. They’ll handle the graphic design and user interface of your website, such as the layout and color scheme. A web developer builds the code that your website runs on, which includes the front-end (the part that your customer sees) and the back-end (where all of the magic happens).\nDepending on what type of business you have, you might place more or less emphasis on each component of the site. For example, a restaurant might need a simple interface that customers can use to view the menu and opening hours, while an e-commerce website might require a more complex back-end with third party integrations.\nYou might choose to use responsive design that looks just as good on a mobile device as it does on a desktop. Or, you might choose to build a separate smartphone app.\nSome developers do web design, and vice-versa, but not all. Whichever type of website you choose, it’s important to make sure that you hire the right person for the task. When you work with Zibtek to build your website, you can be sure that everyone on the team is doing what they do best, and working together to produce a cohesive product.\nWhat sets a custom website apart from the rest?\nThe most obvious benefit to a customized website is that you can create a look and feel that’s entirely your own. Sure, DIY website builders might allow you to upload your own logo, and may even provide templates designed specifically for your industry, but how many of your competitors will be using the exact same design?\nYou might be stuck using a layout that isn’t particularly user-friendly, and there may be limits to how many customized features you can add.\nAdditionally, your site may be hosted on someone else’s server, giving you less control over speed, security, and how you collect and store user data.\nBecause website builders are a one-size-fits-all solution, they may come with tools and features you don’t need, slowing down your website’s functionality.\nA few seconds’ difference may not sound like a lot, but according to some studies, it takes only two seconds for a user to click away from a page that’s too slow.\nCustom websites, on the other hand, are slick and streamlined, with no unwanted tabs and toolbars getting in the way of the user experience.\nThey allow you to design your site’s information architecture from scratch, resulting in better SEO rankings and search engine friendly URLs. They can even be designed to automatically input customer data into your company’s CRM.\nNot every company will benefit from these perks of custom web design, but the more complex your business is, the more likely it is that you’ll need one.\nFrom user accounts and membership forums, to an automated help desk or knowledge base, there’s virtually no limit to what you can create with a custom website design.\nWhile it may be a bigger investment in time and money, it’s tailored specifically to your business’s needs, something that a pre-made template simply can’t offer.\nPhoto by Domenico Loia / Unsplash\nIs custom design still a viable proposition for your business?\nBuilding a custom website can give you a competitive advantage over other businesses like yours. After all, customers are more likely to give your company a shot if your site is easy to read and user-friendly -- and especially if it looks professional and unique.\nThat said, there are some occasions when a custom website just won’t work. If you’re in a hurry to build an online presence and don’t have the time to build a website, start off with a simple landing page or social media profile for now.\nYou can always invest in a custom website once you have a steady customer base or a long-term business plan.\nSome web developers would argue that custom websites are never necessary, and that off-the-shelf solutions are “good enough”.\nAnd the truth is, website builders are improving, and are better now than they were even a few years ago. But there are still a few downsides.\nFor one, if you use a website builder, you’re locked into that platform for the time being. You can’t simply relocate the website to your own server if you outgrow the platform’s storage or bandwidth limits. If you choose to move, you’ll have to start from scratch.\nSecond, website templates are easy to break. It’s tempting to make tweaks to the code on your Wix or Weebly site, but if you mess something up, it can be hard to fix.\nYou can reach out to the support team, but you won’t have a dedicated web developer on your side who can address any issues.\nIn contrast, custom websites are designed for the long-haul. Your website is yours, and you can upgrade it and migrate it whenever you want.\nYour developer can help you create a secure storage system for your customer’s data, and you can even create a custom CRM and apps to go along with your site.\nThere’s simply no way to match the expertise than an experienced developer can bring to the table. That’s why custom sites continue to be in demand -- even in a world where off-the-shelf templates are a dime a dozen.\nAsk yourself these questions to find out if your business would benefit from custom web development.\nIf you think a custom website is right for you, ask yourself these three questions.\nThe first and most important is: can you afford it? A custom website can cost anywhere from $15,000 to $100,000 or more, so it’s not a decision to be made lightly.\nYou’ll need to find a web developer you can trust, and be willing to work with them for an extended period to bring your vision to life.\nYou’ll also need someone to maintain the website and make updates down the road, so building a custom website isn’t a one-time purchase -- it’s an ongoing investment.\nYou should hire a custom developer once you’ve established your business and have a long-term plan, not when you’re still figuring things out.\nThe second question is: do you need tools that a template can’t offer? Remember, for a simple business, a DIY website may be just fine.\nIf you just need to display basic information about your company, such as your address and operating hours, stick with a template.\nBut if you’re expecting to scale up your team, branch out into new areas, or do anything more complicated than advertise your business, go with a custom build.\nA custom website can help you improve your brand’s visibility, while also boosting your productivity with a CRM integration and other customizable features.\nThe third question in: when do you need it by? As we’ve mentioned, custom sites aren’t for businesses that are in a hurry. You can expect your web developer to take 3 months or more to deliver the finished product, from consultation to deployment.\nSo if you have a deadline to meet, or simply want to capitalize on a recent social media mention or some other burst of publicity, go with a template.\nDeveloping a custom website is like launching a new product: it can pay back dividends, but you’ll need to put in some time and attention to get it right.\nPhoto by You X Ventures / Unsplash\nGet a solid custom web development team on your side.\nIf you’re going to invest in a custom website, you’ll want a team of experts on your side. That’s because your options are more varied than ever. From UX design to social media integration to data encryption, you need a web development team that can do it all.\nZibtek works across many industries, including healthcare, media, insurance, retail, and more, to design the most effective tools for your business. Whether you need an iOS or Android app, a CMS-powered website, or a custom CRM, Zibtek can help you create a unique software solution for your industry.\nZibtek’s developers know how to build sites that will look good to your users, while also providing all of the data management and analytical tools you need on the back-end.\nReach out today to get a free quote and see how Zibtek can help your business grow!

    "extractedText": "Advantages of Flutter Over React Native\nIan J.H Reynolds\nExplore Ian J.H Reynolds' expertise in finance and economics through his insightful articles on market trends, investment strategies, and economic analysis.\nMore posts by Ian J.H Reynolds.\nIAN J.H REYNOLDS\n9 JUN 2020 • 3 MIN READ\nThere are many advantages of Flutter over React Native. Flutter and React Native are exceptionally well-supported platforms for hybrid mobile application development. Flutter is built and supported by Google. React Native by Facebook. Both, would be acceptable tools to develop a hybrid application, however Flutter based on our experience, may offer some advantages.\nAdvantages of Flutter Over React Native\nUI\nFlutter uses the Dart framework which has most of the major components required for development built in, making for a far more comprehensive framework. The result is that the framework requires less additional code to bridge communication with the phone’s native modules.\nDart’s flexibility comes from the fact that there are so many frameworks, like Material Design and Cupertino, packed inside. All the required technologies needed to develop mobile apps are available out of the box.\nThe Dart framework uses the Skia C++ engine which has a unified set of protocols, compositions, and channels. Simply put, Flutter has everything needed for app development in the Flutter engine itself.\nRich in UI Components\nFlutter framework is bundled with UI rendering components, device API access, navigation, testing, stateful management, and loads of libraries.\nThis rich set of components removes the need to use third-party libraries.\nIf you use the Flutter framework, it means you will have everything needed for developing mobile apps.\nFlutter also has widgets for Material Design and Cupertino that allow developers to easily render the UI on both iOS and Android platforms.\nFollowing with the ‘everything you need in the box’ structure of flutter there are numerous seamless integrations that don’t require material coding time that are available.\nWhy Use Flutter Over React Native\nFirebase Support\nFlutter has well-documented firebase support. Engineers can use every function of a firebase instance available in Native Mobile development platforms.\nhttps://flutter.dev/docs/development/data-and-backend/firebase\nCalendar Widget Support:\nWith Flutter, engineers get access to a fully customizable calendar widget that can be easily integrated and used out of them box.\nhttps://pub.dev/packages/table_calendar\nRange Sliders\nIn Flutter, engineers get access to a fully customizable range slider widget that we can easily integrated.\nhttps://pub.dev/packages/flutter_xlider\nIntercom Support\nIn Flutter, intercom has a stable version that can be easily integrated.\nhttps://pub.dev/packages/intercom_flutter#-readme-tab-\nApp Size\nWhen compared to the react-native flutter apps produced were smaller in size when compared to the other cross-platform applications.\nPerformance\nThere are more advantages of Flutter over React Native. When it comes to performance, Flutter takes the crown. In nearly all of our tests it has performed much faster than React Native.\nReact Native leverages Javascript to connect to native components via a bridge. Flutter streamlines this process by avoiding the need for a bridge to interact with native components. The speed of development and run time thus gets expedited drastically with Flutter.\nFor instance, you can reach animation runtime speeds of 60 frames per second when using Flutter.\nIt’s also useful for supporting reusing existing code. However, you can easily share code when using React Native, whether you’re developing for an iOS or Android platform as well as use the vast libraries that can help you run animations at 60 frames per second.\nThe use of React Native for hybrid applications makes it a little complicated for developers to run the architect, the native components, and the library without problems. Flutter, on the other hand, makes it easy for developers to reuse existing code. The C ++ engine also supports the language.\nSince Flutter is compiled into the native ARM code for both Android and iOS, performance issues are further mitigated.Flutter vs React Native Verdict: Flutter is the clear winner in case of app performance because who doesn’t like to go faster.

    "extractedText": "Native Vs Cross-Platform App Development\nVedant Vyas\nRead more posts by this author.\nVEDANT VYAS\n20 MAR 2023 • 5 MIN READ\nIn your quest for a mobile app developer, you’ve likely come across the terms “cross-platform app development company” and “native app development company.” We want to say that choosing an app building approach is a simple task, but we’d be lying, and that’s never a good start to a relationship.\nDo you know that:\nOver 250 million apps are downloaded daily? That’s like every person on the planet downloading at least one app in any given month!\nExperts predict the annual number of app downloads worldwide will total $299 billion by the end of 2023, an increase of nearly $25 million over 2022?\nMore than 100 billion apps were downloaded for the first time in 2021, and that number’s expected to reach 200 billion by 2025?\nNo matter how you look at it, that’s a boatload of downloaded apps!\nWhen the iOS App Store launched in 2008, it featured a measly 500 apps. Today? People can choose their gaming, streaming, and social media preferences from more than seven million apps across Android and iOS platforms.\nAnd that brings us to the purpose of this post.\nThe unvarnished truth is there truly aren’t “good” or “bad” app-building options. Native and cross-platform app development are both solid choices, depending on your deadline, budget, and other factors.\nUltimately, the best approach is the one that’s most relevant to your project.\nWhat Is the Difference Between Native and Cross-Platform Apps?\nThe most significant difference between native app development and cross-platform development is that native apps are built with non-reusable code, and cross-platforms have reusable code. Put another way, native apps are designed for a specific operating system, be it Android or iOS; cross-platform apps can be used on multiple operating systems.\nWhen choosing a platform, you’ll want to take into consideration things like:\nEase of development and testing\nTime to market\nCustomizations\nPerformance\nCost-savings\nSecurity and maintenance\nUX or user experience\nNative Vs Cross-Platform App Development\nWhat does this mean for your app aspirations?\nWhile both technologies are practical, each has distinct qualities that apply to individual demands and project scope. Based on planned features, the app’s purpose, your audience, and your budget, it might be best to choose one approach over the other.\nCross-Platform App Development Services and Considerations\nSome engineers refer to cross-platform development as a “write once, run everywhere” approach because it only needs a single reusable codebase to run on multiple operating systems. Popular cross-platform frameworks include Flutter, React Native, and Cordova.\nAside from code reusability, reasons to choose a cross-platform development approach include:\nYou’re building an app that’s just displaying information fetched from the network.\nYou want a faster development process so you can get to market more quickly.\nCost-savings due to building only one app.\nYou’ll find plenty of online nay-saying about using cross-platform app development, but don’t let that scare you away. Some of the world’s best-known tech firms, including Facebook (Meta), Skype, Pinterest, and Airbnb, use the approach. And as development frameworks continue to improve, you get a more consistent and sometimes close-to-native UX experience.\nNative Platform App Development Services and Considerations\nWith native app development, engineers can add more features and capabilities to apps using hardware elements like the camera, microphone, GPS, etc. Google Maps and Spotify both use native apps because of the benefits they provide:\nHigh speed, with most app elements rapidly displayed.\nFlawless operation, even when the user’s offline.\nMore enjoyable UX as users can use actions and gestures they’re familiar with.\nFewer bugs.\nEnhanced security.\nOpting for native app development is generally best when your project:\nInvolves heavy processing.\nRequires a lot of integration with hardware elements like Bluetooth, GPS, and the camera, etc.\nNative app frameworks for Android include Java and Kotline, and Objective-C or Swift for iOS.\nWhich is Better: Native vs. Cross-Platform App Development\nIt often helps to look at a development method’s downsides to understand more clearly which one is best for your goals.\nDisadvantages of native app development include:\nNo code reusability. Building separate apps for Android and iOS means separate coding for each. It should come as no surprise that this requires more time, effort, costs, and resources compared to cross-platform development.\nHigh maintenance costs that are sometimes higher than the actual development costs.\nFinding skilled engineers who can develop the apps back-to-back.\nOn the other hand, when you go with cross-platform app development, you face challenges like:\nSlower apps due to the need for an additional abstraction layer and rendering process for things like fetching and processing images.\nLimited functionality if developers run into trouble accessing features like the camera and microphone for each device.\nLess enjoyable UX ‍due to lower performance and reliability.\nPotential dual marketplace difficulties, as the App Store and Google Play have different mechanisms and requirements.\nCross-platform apps are unable to take advantage of native UX components. Therefore, it can’t deliver the same UX experience that is accustomed to the platform.\nBudgeting For Native vs. Cross-Platform Apps\nBig companies with unlimited budgets tend to choose native app development. But for SMBs that want to develop an MVP (minimal viable product) fast and at a budget price, cross-platform development can be best.\nIn terms of actual dollars spent, you’ll likely save anywhere from 30 to 40 percent on cross-platform development. And outsourcing the work makes it even more affordable. Our software development consulting services include going over everything from best practices to trade-offs to help our clients strike the right balance.\nNative Vs Cross-Platform App Development\nDecoding the Best Platform for Your Apps\nWhich app development process you use will likely come down to cost, time, and how users might respond to the app. Still not clear on which path to choose?\nIt can help to know that, while there are always exceptions, as a rule of thumb, you should choose native development when:\n1. You want to build the most responsive app.\n2. The app requires complete access to all phone resources and sources.\n3. You want it to be as easy as possible to update the app with new features.\nGo with cross-platform development when your app:\n1. Doesn’t require a high level of responsiveness.\n2. Won’t have complex animations or complicated logic.\n3. You want to get the app to market more quickly.\n4. Your budget is limited.\nAs we often say, no universal solution exists for developing an app people will love and use. As a trusted outsource partner, Zibtek offers a free strategy session to help you determine which approach is best suited to your app’s specific needs.\nReady to learn more?

You do proper research if you want to buy the best home in town and get the best value for your money. The research you do will assist you in deciding if you should go ahead and purchase the property. With the advent of shopping on the web, 90% of the buyers do online research before they decide on a purchase.\nThe same diligence that goes into shopping for a house should go into choosing the best web development team. There are many web design and development companies in the market today, roughly 30,0000 easily identifiable in the US market alone, making picking the right web development firm to seem like a mammoth task. Here are some excellent tips which can assist you in finding the best firm with ease.\nTip 1 – Define What type of firm best serves your needs\nVery simply, there are many different types of firms that can fulfill your needs. From insourcing to outsourcing, 24/7 hour development cycles and the like there are numerous vehicles that can fit your need. We recommend defining the need first then building search criteria around that.\nTip 2 – Research Your Perfect Company\nThe vast majority of software development firms are identified by individuals searching for particular keywords using a search engine. While not a bad thing, consider that ranking well for keywords does not equate to proficiency in web development.\nChoose 3 to 5 agencies that rank well for the criteria that match your needs (tip 1). Check the overall design of the site and the way the content is laid out on the website, visual acuity is an important litmus test. Can you find what you are looking for on their site easily? Or is it just a robust landing page to bring you in?\nOne main thing people look for when they are searching for a company is to see if they provide useful information which helps in educating them about the process. The information they put on their website is critical. Consider that if the agency offers value upfront they typically have your best interest in mind.\nNext, consider the following:\nTip 3 – History of the Firm:\nThe number of years a company has been in the business is critical. If they have few years of experience, it indicates lack of knowledge which might affect your project adversely.\nTip 4- Know the Team:\nThe next thing you need to check is the size of the team and company overall. It is vital for you to know if the team is large enough to meet your needs. The smaller the company the more resource-constrained they are going to be when it comes to solving complex tasks; smaller firms simply have the less intellectual capital to leverage. One main thing you need to clarify is if they have an in-house team and specialists. Subcontracting can hurt you badly.\nTip 5 – Portfolio of the Company:\nThe best way to know about a company is to check the latest design and development projects they have worked on. Take notes about what you like and dislike about those particular projects. Most web development teams are open to feedback and will be prepared for questions. Identify similar projects where possible and ask questions about those projects.\nTip 6- References for the Company:\nAsk the company for references and reach out to the clients who have used the services of the company before. Ask them about the experiences they had with the company. Take down notes for your reference. List out both the pros and cons of the company as they come up in conversation.\nTip 7- Search Rankings:\nIf you cannot trace the company when you are using primary location-based keywords, it may not mean the company is not up to the mark; they could just be bad marketers. But if your primary goal is to create a software product that ranks well in searches, you need to work with a company that itself is ranking well.\nTip 8 – Responsiveness of the Web Development Company:\nAfter completing the research about a company, you need to reach out to them if you have not already and observe if they are responsive. Small companies might take more time to respond than the larger ones, which is okay as they have limited sales bandwidth. Larger companies usually have a large sales team in place and hence might respond faster.\nAn excellent company will get back to you in 24 to 48 hours. Look for a company that has a genuine interest in your web development project. Professional companies take the time to understand your requirements first. The very best firms will give you a quote only after they fully understand your product requirements.\nDid the sales team respond back within 24 hours?\nHow professional was their response?\n3. Was it a human being or a robot?\nAre they just trying to sell me or do they care about my project?\nTip 9- Budget:\nOne main reason why prospects find the company is not right for them at a later stage is that they share about their budget limitations after initial conversations have already ended. Instead of doing it in the last minute, it is good to share your budget limitations right at the beginning. Once you find a web development team, you need to ask the following questions:\nHow much do you charge per hour?\nWhat is the starting price point for web design and development?\nMy budget is X. Can you work with or complete the project with the amount I can invest?\nHow much time do you take to build the website?\nWhat is the process you have in place for web design or development? Can you share more details of how the process looks?\nLastly, you need to realize the fact that cost does not play a significant role in qualifying a web development company. The best web design or development company will mesh well with you and find a way to make it work where possible.\nBonus Tip – The Right Fit\nRun through the sales and diligence process with a few firms. Compare notes like the budget and time frames presented by each firm as well as the human elements pointed out in earlier tips.\nHappy hunting! LinkedIn Twitter Email"

One of the ways we deliver exceptional results is by using Agile methodology in our development process. Agile, scrum, iterative are term soften used in the industry to describe structured development of software involving quick iterations and built in feedback mechanisms from stakeholders.\nBut, the general agile framework is often too loose for most firms to follow. Over more than a decade of software development we developed the Practical Agile methodology for software development and use it the core of our software development process.\nAll teams are part skill and part process. We have found that over the years, larger teams and long term projects will fall apart without process. Here is ours.\nSection 1 : Guidelines - Splitting User Stories\nContent:\nSplitting User Stories\nThe INVEST model\nVertical vs Horizontal Splitting\nSplitting User Stories: Example\nBreakdown by Workflow: Example\nSplitting User Stories\nSometimes a user story is too big to fit into a Sprint. The simplest approach to splitting is to look for a literal or implied conjunction “and” or “or” in the text of the story and then create two or more new stories from the parts around the conjunction. For example: “As a user I can do one thing and another thing so that I’m happy.” That can be split into “As a user I can do one thing so that I’m happy” and another story “As a user I can do another thing so that I’m happy.”\nSome ways of splitting a story include:\nSplit by process step – every step is a new user story\nSplit by I/O channel – each I/O channel becomes a separate story\nSplit by user options – the options become the user stories\nSplit by role/persona – each role/persona becomes a separate story\nSplit by data range – every significant range is a new user story (e.g. 0, 1-9, 10-99 or last year, this year, next year).\nSplit by CRUD action – create, read, update, delete (only applicable if each action has business logic and they are asymmetric).\nBreaking down by business rules\nBreaking down by happy / unhappy flow\nBreaking down by input options / platform\nBreaking down by data types or parameters\nBreaking down by operations (CRUD)\nBreaking down by test scenarios / test case\nBreaking down by roles\nBreaking down by ‘optimize now’ vs ‘optimize later’\nBreaking down by browser compatibility\nThe INVEST model is a good way to test whether user stories are well-written.\nI – Independent\nN – Negotiable\nV – Valuable\nE – Estimable\nS – Small\nT – Testable\nIndependent– Each user story must be independent of each other. This prevents any overlap between the items; moreover, it allows the team to implement them in any order.\nNegotiable– The details of the work must be negotiable, both among the stakeholders and the team. Specific requirements and design decisions will be fleshed out during development. Many agile practitioners recommended writing user stories on a note card — this is intentional so that a limited amount of detail can be prescribed.\nValuable– Each user story must add business value to the product, the customer and/or the users’ experience.\nEstimable¬– A good user story can be understood well-enough by the team that they can estimate it — not accurately — but at a high-level they perceive that it has size. It is helpful to understand the relative effort as compared to other user stories.\nSmall– A user story is not small if the team cannot get it done within a single Sprint. As large user stories are split into smaller items, greater clarity about the size and implementation is achieved, which improves the likelihood that the team will get it done within a Sprint.\nTestable– Each user story should be testable; this is a common characteristic of well written requirements. If the team cannot determine how the user story may be tested, it is an indication that either desired functionality or the desired business value is not clear enough.\nIndependent (I)\nUser Stories should be free of dependencies on other user stories.\nUser Stories should be self-contained.\nUser Stories should be completed and released in any order.\nUser Stories should be combined or split in different ways when dependencies occur.\nNegotiable (N)\nUser Stories should not be contractual obligations as they are negotiable.\nUser Stories should be a collaborative negotiation between customers, developers and testers.\nValuable (V)\nUser Stories should be of value to the user or owner of the software.\nUser Stories should not be only of value to developers.\nUser Stories should clearly define the benefit to customers/users to assist in prioritization.\nUser Stories should be written by customers to ensure it is valuable to customers/users.\nEstimatable (E)\nUser Stories should be estimated in terms of story points.\nUser Stories should be clearly understood before it is estimated by development teams.\nUser Stories should contain enough detail before it is estimated by development teams.\nUser Stories may not be estimatable when development teams lack domain knowledge.\nUser Stories may not be estimatable when development teams lack technical knowledge.\nUser Stories may not be estimatable when the user story is too big.\nSmall (S)\nUser Stories should be as small as possible while still providing user value.\nUser Stories should be able to fit into one iteration.\nUser Stories that are too big will be difficult to understand and estimate.\nTestable (T)\nUser Stories should be verified by tests to prove they are implemented correctly.\nUser Stories should contain the story acceptance criteria to guide testing.\nUser Stories should be easily unit tested. (Technical Implementation)\nUser Stories should be easily acceptance tested. (Behavioural)\nUser Stories should be tested in an automated manner where possible.\nDefinition of Done (DoD)\nThere are numerous criteria a team can use to define their Definition of Done. This ensures that teams deliver features that are completed in terms of functionality and quality. Definition of Done is an auditable checklist. The following is a set of possible criteria and activities for a DoD:\nUnit Tests Passed\nAcceptance Criteria Met\nCode Reviewed\nFunctional Tests Passed\nNon-Functional Requirements Met\nProduct Owner Accepts User Story\nUser Story Example\nThe following is an example of a user story.\nHere is another example:\nVertical vs Horizontal Splitting\nThere are two common ways to split user stories: vertically or horizontally. Horizontal breakdown of user stories splits the item at an architectural component level. Example: front end UI, databases or backend services. Whereas, a vertical slice results in working, demonstrable, software which adds business value. Therefore, it is recommended to slice user stories vertically so as to reduce dependencies and improve the team’s ability to deliver a potentially shippable product increment in each sprint.\nSplitting User Stories: Example\nAs a customer I can pay for my order so that I receive the products\nIf the above user story was to be split in a vertical manner, it might be broken down into the various ways a customer can complete a payment. As follows…\nAs a customer I can make a credit card payment for my order so that I collect reward points on my credit card.\nAnd/or\nAs a customer I can make a PayPal payment for my order so that I can securely complete my purchase without sharing credit card details with another retailer.\nThe key point to note in the vertically sliced user stories above is that each story passes the INVEST tests mentioned earlier and therefore a Product Owner can prioritize these user stories based on customer needs. However, if a horizontal approach was used to split the user story (i.e. split by architectural layers and components) then the implementation of such requirements would result in working functionality only when all horizontal components are eventually integrated.\nBreakdown by Workflow: Example\nAnother approach that is commonly used to breakdown user stories is focused on the individual steps a user may take in order to achieve their end goal — that is, a user story which describes a long narrative or “user flow” through a system may be sliced into steps which represent portions of the user’s flow. Continuing from the example above of a customer making a purchase online, the user story can be broken down into the following:\nAs a customer I can review the items being purchased for my order so that I can be confident I’m paying for the correct items.\nAs a customer I can provide my banking information for my order so that I can receive the products I ordered.\nAs a customer I can receive a confirmation ID for my purchase so that I can keep track and keep a record of my purchase.\nSection 2 : Product Backlog Refinement\nContent:\nProduct Backlog Refinement\nGoals\nArtifacts\nProcess of Refinement\nProduct Backlog Refinement\nGoals\nGet the Product Backlog Ready for the next Sprint Planning meeting\nGet 6 months of Product Backlog Items estimated so the Product Owner (PO) can forecast well\nWho: whole Scrum team\nThe whole Scrum team is invited. The Product Owner is present—he is responsible for the Product Backlog. The Scrum Master is present—he is a good facilitator and can help the team succeed. The Development Team members are present—they are responsible for estimating the size of the Product Backlog Items (PBIs), and they want to be familiar with the PBIs before Sprint Planning.\nWhen & where\nSame time and place, every week: so everyone knows and everyone can participate\n2-hour time box\nArtifacts\nInput: The input to the workshop is the Product Backlog in its current state.\nOutput: The output is a Product Backlog that is more Ready\nProcess of Refinement\nTo conduct the workshop, follow these steps:\nIn 30-minute cycles,\nThe PO presents the next PBIs in the order of priority that aren’t Ready to the team. (up to 5 minutes)\nFor each PBI in the order of priority, follow the steps outlined below\n*PO: Discuss the PBI (what and the why)\nSection 3 : Sprint Review\nContent:\nSPRINT REVIEW\nSPRINT REVIEW OVERVIEW\nSPRINT REVIEW TIMING\nSPRINT REVIEW PARTICIPANTS\nSPRINT REVIEW PREWORK\nSPRINT REVIEW APPROACH\nOverview (Summarize)\nDemonstrate\nDiscuss\nAdapt\nSPRINT REVIEW\nNear the end of the sprint, the team conducts two important inspect and adapt activities:\nThe sprint review\nThe sprint retrospective.\nSPRINT REVIEW OVERVIEW\nThe sprint review is the time when the Scrum team invites its stakeholders to give feedback on the product itself. Recall that during spring planning, the team planned the work. During spring execution the team did the work. And now, in the sprint review, the team inspects the result of the work—the potentially shippable product increment.\nSPRINT REVIEW TIMING\nThe sprint review occurs near the end of the sprint, just after sprint execution and just before the sprint retrospective\nSPRINT REVIEW PARTICIPANTS\nThe sprint review is an excellent opportunity for the Scrum team to get feedback from people who typically are not available on a daily basis during sprint execution. For these individuals, the sprint review is their first opportunity to see and discuss the work that was produced during the sprint. The invitation list for the sprint review, therefore, should include all interested parties.\nThe entire Scrum team (development team, ScrumMaster, and product owner) should attend. Other potential attendees include internal stakeholders (e.g., internal users or subject matter experts) other internal teams (e.g., marketing or support), and even external stakeholders (e.g., external customers or partners).\nSPRINT REVIEW PREWORK\nAlthough sprint reviews are informal by design, the teams should do some minimal prep work.\nInvitations\nThe team must determine who to invite. The list is likely to vary somewhat from sprint to sprint depending on the work accomplished during the sprint.\nScheduling\nThe sprint review should be scheduled around the availability of a few must-have stakeholders. Ideally, this day and time could be fixed for all of the sprints, so that it occurs at a regular cadence. Remember that the sprint review should be time-boxed, and typically takes somewhere between 2 and 4 hours depending on sprint length.\nConfirmation\nThe team can only present completed work at the review, so sometime before the sprint review, the team must ensure that the work is indeed done.\nDemo Prep\nThis is to show case the work done during the sprint. Since the work is already done by the time this meeting is happening, not much preparation is required unless product owner/product manager needs a different method of Demo (such as a PowerPoint of screens etc )\nRole Determination\nThe team needs to decide who on the Scrum team is going to facilitate the review (often, but not always, the Scrum-Master) and who is going to demonstrate the completed work.\nSPRINT REVIEW APPROACH\nThe inputs to the sprint review are the sprint goal, sprint backlog, and the potentially shippable product increment that the team actually produced during the sprint. The outputs are a groomed product backlog and an updated release plan. A common approach to conducting the sprint review is as follows: Overview (Summarize), Demonstrate, Discuss, and Adapt.\nOverview (Summarize)\nThe sprint review kicks off with a Scrum team member (often the product owner) presenting the sprint goal, the product backlog items associated with that goal (often the sprint backlog), and an overview of the product increment that the team achieved during the sprint. This information provides a summary or synopsis of how the sprint results compare with the sprint goal. The purpose of the review is to describe what was accomplished and then to use the information to determine the best course of action for moving forward.\nDemonstrate\nI want to take a moment to caution you about the term demo or sprint demo. Although a demonstration is frequently a quite helpful part of a sprint review, it is not the aim of the review.\nThe most important aspect of the sprint review is the in-depth conversation and collaboration among the participants. Through these interactions, the Scrum team surfaces and exploits productive adaptations. The demo is merely a way to jump-start the conversation around something concrete.\nSometimes the team builds functionality that doesn't lend itself easily to a demo. That is not a valid excuse to exclude it from the demo. A team that gives it some thought, can always find a way to show stakeholders the work of the sprint.\nDiscuss\nAll sprint reviews should elicit vigorous discussion. Participants who aren't on the Scrum team should ask questions, understand the current state of the product, and help guide the product's direction with their feedback. The Scrum team should leave with a deeper appreciation for the business and marketing side of their product while getting feedback on the convergence of the product toward delighted customers or users.\nAs such, the sprint review is the perfect place to discuss observations, comments and feedback regarding the product and its current trajectory. It is not, however, the best venue for deep problem solving; that kind of work should be deferred to another meeting.\nAdapt\nThrough demonstration and discussion, the Scrum team is able to ask and answer the following questions:\nDo the stakeholders like what they see?\nDo they want to see changes?\nIs what we're building still a good idea in the marketplace or to our internal customers?\nAre we missing an important feature?\nAre we overdeveloping/investing in a feature where we don't have to?\nAsking and answering these questions provides input on how to adapt the product backlog and release plans. The sprint review gives teams an opportunity to identify ways to adapt, to respond to change, when it is still affordable to do so—at the end of every single sprint.\nSection 4 : Sprint Planning\nContents:\nSPRINT PLANNING\nPARTICIPANTS IN SPRINT PLANNING\nINPUTS TO SPRINT PLANNING\nOUTPUTS OF SPRINT PLANNING\nSPRINT PLANNING PROCESS\nDetermine Team Capacity\nSprint Planning Approach\nRefine the Sprint Goal\nFinalize the Commitment\nProduct backlogs typically contain much more work than can be completed in a single sprint. So, each sprint begins with sprint planning.\nSprint planning is a recurring, just-in-time activity that occurs at the beginning of each sprint, when the entire Scrum team gathers to agree on a sprint goal and to select a subset of product backlog items it can commit to accomplish during the sprint. For a two-week to month-long sprint, sprint planning should take no longer than four to eight hours to complete.\nThe participants, inputs, outputs, and basic process of sprint planning are shown in the image below.\nPARTICIPANTS IN SPRINT PLANNING\nThe full Scrum team collaborates during sprint planning. This includes the development team, the product owner, and the ScrumMaster.\nINPUTS TO SPRINT PLANNING\nSprint planning relies on a set of inputs that guide the development team in determining what value it can realistically deliver during the sprint. These sprint planning inputs are as follows:\nProduct Backlog\nThe highest priority PBIs should already be groomed, which typically means the PBIs have acceptance criteria, and have been sized appropriately, estimated, and prioritized.\nTeam Velocity\nThe team's historical velocity is one indicator of how much work is practical for the team to complete in a single sprint.\nConstraints\nThe team should have identified any business or technical constraints that could materially affect what the team's can deliver.\nTeam Capabilities\nThe team should know which team members are available (and what their availability is) for this particular sprint, as well as which skills each team member has.\nInitial Sprint Goal\nThe product owner should have identified the business objective he ideally would like to see accomplished during the sprint.\nOUTPUTS OF SPRINT PLANNING\nAt the end of sprint planning, the development team communicates its commitment through the two sprint planning outputs: a finalized sprint goal and a sprint backlog.\nSPRINT PLANNING PROCESS\nThe process of sprint planning can be accomplished in several ways, but in general there are two approaches to sprint planning: two-part sprint planning and one-part sprint planning. Both approaches begin with the team determining its capacity.\nDetermine Team Capacity\nPut simply, a team's capacity is the estimated total number of hours the team will have available to work on product backlog items during the sprint, minus other regular sprint activities, non-sprint commitments, and planned time off. The capacity should take into account individual team member skills as well, especially highly specialized skills that might have very limited availability during a sprint. Most teams also reserve some buffer time against the unplanned and unexpected including but not limited to maintenance, run the business and impromptu meetings based on past experience.\nSprint Planning Approach\nThe development teams begins by determining its capacity to deliver work. Based on available capacity, the sprint goal may need to be refined. Next, the team selects the highest priority requested product backlog item and acquires confidence that the selected item will reasonably fit within the sprint, given other items already included in the team's evolving commitment. This cycle is then repeated in priority order until the team is out of capacity to do any more work. At that point, the team finalizes its commitment and sprint planning is over.\nRefine the Sprint Goal\nThe sprint goal summarizes the business purpose and value of the sprint. The product owner comes to sprint planning with an initial sprint goal, but the sprint goal would be refined over the course of sprint planning to match the reality of what can be delivered during the sprint.\nFinalize the Commitment\nAt the completion of sprint planning, the development team finalizes its commitment to the business value it will deliver by the end of the sprint. This commitment is expressed in a refined sprint goal and sprint backlog.\nSection 5 : Sprint Execution\nContents:\nSPRINT EXECUTION\nOVERVIEW\nTIMING\nPARTICIPANTS\nPROCESS\nTask Planning\nFlow Management\nDaily Scrum\nTask Performance—Technical Practices\nCommunicating\nSprint execution is the work the Scrum team performs during each sprint to meet the sprint goal. The principles and techniques that guide how the Scrum team plans, manages, performs, and communicates during sprint execution are described below.\nOVERVIEW\nEvery sprint, the team executes a mini-project unto itself—it performs all of the work necessary to deliver a potentially shippable product implement. The team's work is guided by the sprint goal and sprint backlog.\nTIMING\nThe majority of the team's time each sprint should be spent in sprint execution. It begins after sprint planning and continues until the sprint review begins.\nPARTICIPANTS\nDuring sprint execution, the development team members self-organize to determine the best way possible to meet the sprint goal.\nThe ScrumMaster coaches, facilitates, and removes any impediments that block or slow the team's progress.\nThe product owner is available to answer questions, review intermediate work, and provide feedback to the team.\nThe product owner might also be called upon to discuss adjustments to the sprint goal or to verify acceptance criteria.\nPROCESS\nTask Planning\nDuring sprint planning the team produces a high-level plan for how to achieve the sprint goal, usually in the form of a sprint backlog. Team members perform just-in-time task-level planning as needed, as opposed to trying to formulate a detailed plan or Gantt chart.\nFlow Management\nThe idea of flow management is to empower team. It is the team's responsibility to manage the flow of work throughout the sprint to meet the sprint goal. This includes making decisions about how much work the team should do in parallel, which work to start, how to organize the task-level work, which work to do, and who should do the work.\nParallel Work and Swarming\nThe team must determine how many product backlog items to work on in parallel(this is WIP limit, ideally not to exceed 2 items), in other words, at the same time. Working on too many items at once slows the team down. But working on too few items at once is equally wasteful.\nThe goal is to reduce the time required to complete individual items while maximizing the total value delivered during the sprint. Another name for this approach is swarming. Swarming is when team members with available capacity work together to complete one unfinished item rather than moving ahead to work on new items. This doesn't mean teams should always work on only one item at a time—the actual number of open items at any one time is highly dependent on context. Teams will have to experiment to find the balance that maximizes the value they deliver each sprint.\nWhich Items to Start\nThe simplest way to choose the product backlog item to work on next is to select the highest-priority item as specified by the product owner. Unfortunately, this doesn't always work. In reality, dependencies or skills capacity constraints might dictate a different order. The development team should be enabled to opportunistically select work as appropriate. This should ideally happen in Spring Planning meeting but sometimes they come up during daily standup and/or when the team or a team member is impeded or have realized something new.\nHow to Organize Task Work\nIt's tempting for new agile teams to approach task level work in a waterfall fashion: design it, code it, and then test it. It's better, however, to approach the work from a value and delivery-focused mindset. This means minimizing the amount of time work sits idle and reducing the size of handoffs. In practice, this sometimes looks like a developer and tester pairing at the start of a task to work in a highly interleaved fashion, with rapid cycles of test creation, code creation, test execution, and test and code refinement. This approach keeps work flowing, supports very fast feedback, and enables team members to swarm on an item to get it done.\nWhat Tasks Needs to Be Done?\nThe team should decide which task-level work it needs to perform to complete a product backlog item. Product owners and stakeholders influence these choices by defining the scope of a feature and creating acceptance criteria. They also provide business-facing requirements for the team's definition of done. Overall, the team and the product owner must work together to ensure that technical decisions with important business consequences are made in an economically sensible way.\nWho Does the Work?\nWho should work on each task? An obvious answer is the person best able to quickly and correctly get it done. But based on team maturity this is negotiable for cross training and sustainability. Functional Manager or the team leads this discussion in planning meeting. And if that person is unavailable, the team should decide on the next best person.\nDaily Scrum\nThe daily scrum is a critical daily inspect-and-adapt activity to help the team achieve sprint goal. It is a 15-minute, timeboxed activity that takes place once every 24 hours. The purpose of the daily scrum is to get the people who are focused on meeting the sprint goal together to share the big picture of what is happening so that they can collectively understand how much to work on which items to start working on, and how best to organize the work among the team members. It is essential for flow management.\n“Taking a systemic view of product development where we organize and optimize the teams and other resources (the system) to pull WIP-limited quantities of appropriately-size work items into the system and quickly delivery value to the customer (fast), while adapting to the specific needs of developing novel, non-cookie-cutter solutions (flexible), the whole time relentlessly focusing on removing impediments that inhibit fast and flexible development (to achieve good flow). 2. Term used by Womack and Jones in their book Lean Thinking (1996).”\nTask Performance—Technical Practices\nDevelopment team members are expected to be technically good at what they do. For example, if you are using Scrum to develop software, team members need to be skilled in good technical practices for developing software, such as continuous integration, automated testing, refactoring, test-driven development, and so on. Teams that fail to develop strong technical skills generally fall short of achieving the long-term benefits of Scrum.\nCommunicating\nScrum teams should use highly visible methods to communicate progress. Two of the most popular are a task board and a sprint burndown or sprint burnup chart.\nTask Board\nThe task board is a simple but powerful way to communicate sprint progress at a glance. The sample task board below lists each PBI and its associated tasks. The tasks remain in the To-Do column until the team starts work on them. Then, as the team begins work on a task, the team moves that task to an in-progress column, and eventually to the completed column.\nSprint Burndown Chart\nThe sprint burndown chart tracks how many hours of effort remain on each task, by day. Each day, the team updates its in-progress tasks with an estimate of how much work is remaining. It adds these task hours to the total number of hours estimated for any tasks that haven't yet been started and plots the results on the sprint burndown chart, as shown below. The sprint burndown chart is useful for tracking progress and can also be used as a leading indicator to predict when work will be completed. Note that sprint burndown charts always use estimated effort remaining. They do not capture actual effort expended.\nSprint Burnup Chart\nA sprint burn-up chart is another way to visualize progress through a sprint. Often, sprint burn-up charts are plotted using story points. Each day, the sum of completed product backlog items to date, as measured in story points, is charted. Burnup charts allow teams to see at a glance how well (or how poorly) product backlog items are flowing through the sprint. An ideal burnup chart shows a steady rise in completed items from early in the sprint to the end of the sprint (see dark blue line in the figure below). If your burnup chart shows almost no progress in terms of completed items until the last few days of the sprint (see light blue line in the figure below), you should consider that a red flag.\nSection 6 : Sprint Retrospective\nContent:\nSprint Retrospective\nOVERVIEW\nSPRINT RETROSPECTIVE TIMING\nSPRINT RETROSPECTIVE PARTICIPANTS\nSPRINT RETROSPECTIVE PREWORK\nDefine Retrospective Focus\nSelect Exercises\nGather Objective Data\nStructure the Retrospective\nSPRINT RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH\nSet the Atmosphere\nCreate Shared Context\nIdentify Insights\nDetermine Actions\nDOT VOTING\nCLOSE THE RETROSPECTIVE\nFOLLOW THROUGH\nOVERVIEW\nSprint retrospectives give the whole Scrum team an opportunity to stop for a moment and examine what's happening, analyze the way they work, identify ways to improve, and make plans to implement these improvements. Anything that affects how the team creates the product is open to scrutiny and discussion. Retrospectives are crucial because they give Scrum teams the chance to customize Scrum to their unique circumstances.\nSPRINT RETROSPECTIVE TIMING\nThe sprint retrospective typically is the last activity of the sprint. It should generally recur at the same weekday, time, and place each sprint.\nAll retrospectives should be timeboxed; in most cases, a sprint retrospective should take between one hour and three hours, depending on sprint length. Do not spend less than one hour or more than four.\nSPRINT RETROSPECTIVE PARTICIPANTS\nThe entire Scrum team (development team, ScrumMaster, and product owner) should attend the sprint retrospective. The development team includes everyone who is designing, building and testing the product. Collectively, the Scrum team members have the diverse perspectives necessary to reflect on the progress and suggest improvements.\nOn certain occasions, the Scrum team might also decide to invite people from outside the Scrum team if their insights or perspectives will contribute to team learning during the retrospective.\nSPRINT RETROSPECTIVE PREWORK\nNot all sprint retrospectives require prework. For short-duration sprints or for teams who are using a well-practiced format, little if any prework is required.\nDefine Retrospective Focus\nThe default retrospective focus is to review all relevant aspects of the process used during the previous sprint. However, sometimes teams want to alter the focus for a particular retrospective depending on what is important to the team and where improvements are needed. Some teams might want to focus on ways they can improve technical skills; others might want to problem solve ways to build features that better match customer expectations.\nEstablishing and communicating the focus of the retrospective ahead of time allows the team to determine if any non-Scrum members should be invited. It also allows the team to select appropriate retrospective exercises and gather any necessary data.\nSelect Exercises\nTeams also need to choose exercises that will help them engage, think, explore, and make decisions. Some common exercises are to create and mine a sprint event timeline, brainstorming, and grouping and voting.\nDuring prework, teams don't have to decide exactly which exercises they will use—they need only do enough research to have some exercise choices and materials and data available to support any of the potential exercises.\nGather Objective Data\nAny legwork needed to collect data should happen before the retrospective. Objective data is hard data (not opinions), such as what events happened and when, counts of the number of PBIs that were started and not finished, or the feature burnup for the sprint. At this time, the data only needs to be collected, not analyzed.\nStructure the Retrospective\nBecause retrospectives can vary in length, place, participants, and time, it's a good idea to review the desired structure as part of the retrospective prework. The exact length will depend on how many people are on the team, how new the team is, whether any team members are located remotely and so on.\nSPRINT RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH\nThe tangible prework items (focus, exercises, and objective data) are inputs to the retrospective. Other inputs include subjective data and the insight backlog. Outputs include a list of improvement actions, the updated insight backlog, and improved camaraderie.\nThe team's approach to a sprint retrospective can be as simple as Scrum team members coming together to discuss questions such as\nWhat worked well this sprint that we want to continue doing?\nWhat didn't work well this sprint that we should stop doing?\nWhat should we start doing or improve?\nSet the Atmosphere\nEstablish the atmosphere that makes people feel comfortable and safe. Find simple ways to get them talking.\nCreate Shared Context\nA group of people can experience the same event and yet interpret it quite differently. To create a shared context among a team, first ground the retrospective by sharing objective data about the sprint. Then invite people to share subjective data—what were some things they observed during the sprint and/or how did they feel about the sprint?\nIdentify Insights\nThe participants next identify insights by collaboratively examining, interpreting, and understanding both the objective and subjective data. Doing this effectively requires a system-level focus, which helps teams find the root cause of issues.\nBrainstorming is an excellent activity for capturing insights. Another source might be the team's insight backlog, a list of previously generated insights that have not yet been acted upon. The insight backlog is typically updated at the end of each sprint to reflect new insights.\nDetermine Actions\nOnce the team has identified their insights, they need to move from discussing them to taking demonstrable actions to leverage them.\nOften, the team identifies more insights than it can address during any one sprint. When this happens, the team will need to prioritize the insights, perhaps through dot voting or some other prioritization activity. The team members will also need to determine how much capacity they will have for any improvement actions during the upcoming sprint.\nOnce the team has prioritized its insights and estimated its capacity, the team can define concrete, actionable steps to leverage the insights and improve the Scrum process. Most actions will take the form of specific tasks that one or more Scrum team members will perform during the upcoming sprint. Sometimes the actions represent impediments that the ScrumMaster might own but someone outside the Scrum team must resolve. Sometimes, teams discover that it isn't possible to immediately address the insight and have to choose instead to explore the insight. All of these actions can be tracked in the insight backlog.\nDot Voting\nA technique that allows participants to vote their preferences among a set of items by placing a colored dot on items that they believe are higher priority than other items. Items with more dots are higher priority than items with fewer dots. This can also be achieved by asking team members to writing the insights and group them by theme and pick the most ranked theme.\nClose the Retrospective\nThe last step is to close out the retrospective. Many do this by recapping the actions the team has decided to take based on what the participants learn. It is also a good time to appreciate people and their participation. I also recommend asking the team for suggestions to improve future retrospectives. A retrospective is, after all, part of the Scrum framework and as such should also be subject to inspection and adaptation.\nFOLLOW THROUGH\nTo ensure that what happens in the sprint retrospective does not just stay in the sprint retrospective, the participants should follow up on the actions they choose to complete. Frequently the easiest way to handle the improvement actions is to populate the sprint backlog with tasks corresponding to each action prior to bringing in new features. The teams available capacity to work on new features would then be adjusted downward by the estimated time these improvement tasks will take. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

Whether you want to build such a team to cover periodic resource needs or to beat your competitors to the punch, the model provides you with a multidisciplinary team of professionals who help you meet your software goals. And the team you put together can be the difference between a pennant race and languishing in the cellar.\nYep, we’re heading out to the baseball stadium for some peanuts, Cracker Jack, and education on what a winning development team looks like.\nYou don’t need to be a baseball fan to know who the Yankees are. One of the most successful professional sports teams in the US, they’ve won an amazing 27 World Series, an MLB record. They’ve had incredible lineups over the years, but most game historians agree the 1927 team featuring Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, and Bob Meusel (nicknamed “Murderer’s Row) was the best of all time. What made them so great was a combination of good management, record home runs, and player expertise that swept away the competition. To this day, the Yanks remain the gold standard that all other teams are measured by.\nNow consider another New York team, the Mets. The 1962 inaugural team remains a historical example of how poor talent and a lack of cohesiveness can lead to disastrous outcomes (apologies to any Mets fans in the audience, but a fact’s a fact). The team lacked talent and experience, with many players past their prime or not yet developed. Inconsistent pitching, an error-prone defense, and few runs made them a symbol of team futility, even with the legendary Casey Stengel as their manager.\nJust as the Yanks set a gold standard in teamwork and the Mets proved how a lack of talent and synergy can lead to a worst-case scenario, the dedicated software development team you build can be one where each player complements the other to achieve success or one that grapples with missed deadlines, budget overruns, and low-quality output.\nHere’s how to ensure your efforts result in a team that delivers a grand slam every time.\nWhat Characteristics Should I Look For in Dedicated Software Development Team Members?\nPutting together a dedicated software development team is no simple feat. It isn’t just about having a large budget or scouting for only the most talented engineers. It’s a complex, nuanced process that calls for strategic thinking, long-term planning, and a thorough understanding of what a dedicated team does.\nThe right skill sets, team chemistry, and a shared vision for the project are a good start. Other characteristics to focus on include:\nHigh level of professionalism\nGood communication skills\nClearly defined roles within the team\nAdaptability\nHow to Build a Dedicated Software Development Team\nWhile building such a dream team is challenging, working with an experienced, strategic partner with expertise in creating exceptional software products can ease the process and significantly increase the odds of success.\nWhere Can I Find the Right Talent for My Software Development Project?\nCompetition in the tech market can be a major barrier when looking for skilled developers. Fortunately, this isn’t true with dedicated teams, where you have access to a global talent pool that allows you to choose the perfect team to meet your needs.\nTo build your team, start by sourcing dedicated software developers with the “right” skills to complement your in-house capabilities. At Zibtek, we work with you to pick team members from a talent pool of software engineers and designers with the background, technical skills, language level, and soft skills most suited to your project.\nWe help to seamlessly integrate our team into yours, appoint a team leader with a solid technical background, and establish clear communication channels to ensure everyone’s on the same page. Our expertise in managing dedicated teams enables us to efficiently handle resource allocation, project timelines, and quality control. You can be confident you’re building a team skilled in technology and aligned with your goals and culture.\nHow Much Should I Expect to Pay a Software Development Team Member?\nIt’s probably no surprise that labor costs are the most significant expense of most software projects. In the US the rates can range from $50-$120 an hour depending on experience level. The good news is that you can significantly lower these costs by forming a dedicated development team instead of adding to your in-house one.\nDedicated team models typically have a simple and transparent pricing structure: monthly payments are based on team size and comprised of salaries and a service provider fee, which includes administrative overhead.\nYour actual costs will depend on the project’s complexity, the time involved, and where the work is done. For instance, the average annual software developer salary in India is about a tenth of that in the US.\nHow to Build a Dedicated Software Development Team\nHow Can Zibtek Help Me Assemble My Team?\nTop reasons to hire a dedicated software development team include:\nWorking with agile principles.\nScaling your team up or down during the project.\nReducing operation expenses.\nSaving time with more flexibility.\nQuality Assurance Services\nAs you build your dedicated team, Zibtek is much like a baseball team’s general manager.

    "extractedText": "Common custom software development roadblock (and how to avoid them)\nVedant Vyas\nRead more posts by this author.\nVEDANT VYAS\n20 NOV 2023 • 6 MIN READ\nCustom software development is the process of creating a software application that meets the specific needs of a client or a business. It can offer many benefits, such as increased efficiency, scalability, security, and competitive advantage. However, custom software development also comes with its own challenges and risks that can derail the project or compromise its quality. In this blog post, we will explore some of the common roadblocks that can occur during the custom software development process and how to avoid them.\nWhat might stand in my way at the beginning of the custom software development process?\nOne of the first hurdles that can hinder the success of a custom software development project is **lack of clear requirements**. Without a clear vision of what the software should do, how it should look, and who it should serve, the project can suffer from scope creep, delays, rework, and dissatisfaction. To avoid this, it is essential to conduct a thorough analysis of the business needs, goals, and expectations before starting the development process. A good way to do this is to use a **requirements document** that outlines the features, functions, design, and quality standards of the software. This document can serve as a guide for both the client and the developer throughout the project.\nAnother common roadblock at the beginning of the custom software development process is **choosing the wrong technology stack**. The technology stack refers to the combination of programming languages, frameworks, tools, and platforms that are used to build and run the software. Choosing the wrong technology stack can lead to compatibility issues, performance problems, security vulnerabilities, and maintenance difficulties. To avoid this, it is important to consider factors such as the functionality, scalability, reliability, security, and cost of the software when selecting the technology stack. It is also advisable to consult with an expert who can recommend the best technology stack for your project based on your requirements and budget.\nCommon custom software development roadblock and how to avoid them?\nHow do I avoid this?\nTo avoid these roadblocks at the beginning of the custom software development process, you should:\n- Conduct a thorough analysis of your business needs, goals, and expectations\n- Create a detailed requirements document that outlines the features, functions, design, and quality standards of the software\n- Choose a suitable technology stack that matches your functionality, scalability, reliability, security, and cost requirements\n- Consult with an expert who can advise you on the best technology stack for your project\nWhat might stand in my way as I continue the custom software development process?\nAs you proceed with the custom software development process, you might encounter some challenges that can affect the progress and quality of your project. One of these challenges is **poor communication**. Poor communication can lead to misunderstandings, conflicts, errors, and delays in the project. Poor communication can occur between different stakeholders involved in the project, such as the client, the developer, the end-user, and other third parties. To avoid this, it is essential to establish clear and frequent communication channels throughout the project. A good way to do this is to use a **collaboration tool** that allows you to share information, feedback, updates, and issues in real-time. You should also define roles and responsibilities for each stakeholder and set expectations for communication frequency and format.\nAnother challenge that can arise during the custom software development process is *inadequate testing*. Inadequate testing can result in bugs, defects and errors in the software that can compromise its functionality,\nUsability and security. Inadequate testing can occur due to lack of time, Resources or expertise in testing.\nTo avoid this,\nit is important to conduct thorough testing throughout\nthe development process. A good way to do this is to use a **testing strategy** that defines\nthe types, levels, and methods of testing that will be performed on the software.\nYou should also use automated testing tools that can help you\ndetect and fix errors faster and more efficiently.\nHow do I avoid this?\nTo avoid these challenges during the custom software development process, you should:\n- Establish clear and frequent communication channels throughout the project\n- Use a collaboration tool that allows you to share information, Feedback, updates, and issues in real-time\n- Define roles and responsibilities for each stakeholder and set expectations for communication frequency and format\n- Conduct thorough testing throughout the development process\n- Use a testing strategy that defines the types, levels, and methods of testing that will be performed on the software\n- Use automated testing tools that can help you detect and fix errors faster and more efficiently\nWhat might stand in my way as I complete the custom software development process?\nAs you complete the custom software development process, you might face some obstacles that can affect the delivery and deployment of your software. One of these obstacles is **lack of user feedback**.\n- Lack of user feedback can lead to a software that does not meet the needs, preferences, and expectations of the end-users.\n- Lack of user feedback can occur due to lack of user involvement, user testing, or user acceptance testing in the development process.\nTo avoid this,\nit is crucial to collect and incorporate user feedback throughout the development process.\nA good way to do this is to use a **user-centric design** approach that puts the end-user at the center of the development process.\nYou should also conduct user testing and user acceptance testing at various stages of the development process to ensure that the software meets the user requirements and satisfaction.\nAnother obstacle that can hinder the completion of the custom software development process is **deployment issues**.\nDeployment issues can cause delays,downtime, or failures in the launch of your software.\nDeployment issues can occur due to technical glitches, compatibility problems, or configuration errors in the deployment environment.\nTo avoid this,\nit is vital to prepare and test your software for deployment before going live.\nA good way to do this is to use a **continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD)** pipeline that automates the building, testing, and deployment of your software.\nYou should also use a staging environment that mimics\nthe production environment to test your software for deployment readiness.\nHow do I avoid this?\nTo avoid these obstacles as you complete the custom software development process,\nyou should:\n- Collect and incorporate user feedback throughout the development process\n- Use a user-centric design approach that puts the end-user at the center of the development process\n- Conduct user testing and user acceptance testing at various stages of the development process to ensure that the software meets the user requirements and satisfaction\n- Prepare and test your software for deployment before going live\n- Use a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline that automates the building,testing, and deployment of your software\n- Use a staging environment that mimics the production environment to test your software for deployment readiness\nCommon custom software development roadblock\nHow can Zibtek help mitigate risk as I develop custom software?\nZibtek is a leading custom software development company that can help you overcome the roadblocks and challenges that you might face during the custom software development process.

At its core, the UX is the experience that users have with a particular app. Developers need to pay special attention to this component as it’s what’s going to drive success for the app.\nOn the other hand, the user interface is the elements that users directly interact with when they’re using the app. This can be things like buttons, menu bars, windows, etc. It’s one of the ways that developers can make their creations truly unique.\nWhat’s the difference between UX and UI design?\nIt’s actually quite common for the UX and UI terms to be used interchangeably, however, they are fundamentally different. Most people tend to use these terms interchangeably because both of these components are crucial for the success of a product.\nAn app needs to have a great user experience in addition to a unique user interface if it's to have any chance of succeeding in the very competitive app landscape. Therefore, each of these components have a distinct role to play. They each refer to a different aspect of the product development process.\nThe term user experience was coined by Don Norman, the co-founder of the Nielsen Norman Group design consultancy. At its core, UX is supposed to be a human-first way of designing products and services. This is an all-encompassing design philosophy that's not necessarily limited to the tech or digital medium.\nTherefore, the job of a UX designer is to always strive to improve the quality of interaction between the user and the product. It's not concerned with specific visual elements, rather, UX is focused on the overall feeling that the product or service evokes from its user.\nThe user interface is there for a completely different reason. It's the first point of interaction between the digital product and the user. It’s also the first thing that users judge when they launch an app for the first time. If the interface has been poorly designed or is just too clunky, chances are that users won’t really give the app a second thought.\nA user interface designer thus has to make sure that the app's interface is as great as it can be. They have to think clearly about all of the visual elements that are to be incorporated, be it the buttons, icons, fonts, colors, spacing between the visual elements, etc.\nThe importance of great user interface design can be underpinned by the fact that it’s difficult for an app to have a great user experience unless it doesn’t have a great user interface.\nHow important is UX/UI design to your custom app?\nEven though they’re completely different in form and function, UX/UI design is extremely important for a custom app. It’s impossible for an app to succeed commercially, or even serve its intended purpose if it’s not meant to be a commercial app, unless the developers have nailed the UX/UI design.\nThere has been a significant shift in the way people interact particularly with mobile devices over the past decade. Smartphones have become larger and faster. Users these days have little patience for apps that don't look good or just feel too much of a bother to use.\nThis is what makes or breaks apps nowadays. For example, if a news aggregator app takes longer to load articles, the vast majority of its users would simply open up their respective app store and download another one of the many aggregator apps. They would always prefer apps that are quicker and more efficient.\nAlso the speed and performance of the application is a large factor for the whole user experience and can also be a deal breaker. Check out our FAQ's on this topic on this page.\nWhat makes a good UX/UI design?\nIt doesn’t take much to achieve a good UX/UI design. What’s more important is the understanding of what the app is supposed to do and exactly how it’s supposed to make the lives of its users easier. Once there’s clarity on this, work can begin and it’s imperative that the focus must always be on improving the user experience.\nGood UX design is focused on helping users do what they want to do when they interact with your app. It shouldn't confuse your users, shouldn't make them feel rushed or make it appear that the app is just trying to complicate their lives more. Keeping the feeling of your target demographic in mind will ensure that the UX design pleases people.\nGiven that we live in a fast-paced world, users prefer simplicity and being able to get the job done quickly. For an app, this means that the user flow should be clearly thought out. The user shouldn’t feel that they’re going round in circles or that they’re unable to find the information that they’re looking for.\nAs far as the user interface is concerned, most experts are of the view that the best UI is one that’s almost invisible to the user, in that it doesn’t take away from the experience by being too outlandish or disconnected with the reality of the app.\nA good practice is to use common UI elements so that users aren’t taken by surprise when they navigate through the app. This will also make the UI appear consistent which will allow the user to feel comfortable.\nWhy UX/UI design is an important part of custom app development\nYou might have stumbled upon an app idea that truly does something that no other app on the market does. However, in order to transform that vision into reality, you actually need to develop the app. What you intend for it to do and the benefit that you aim to provide users with it will not be possible unless the UX and UI work in perfect harmony.\nThat’s why great UX/UI design is such an important part of custom app development. Users won’t be able to take the full advantage of the app’s functionality if the UI is too clunky and that would automatically result in an inferior user experience.\nAn app that can’t do what it’s supposed to, or makes it very difficult to access its core functionality, is basically worthless. Even if it’s just an app that’s supposed to be used internally within your organization, if it doesn’t help make users’ lives easier, then it doesn’t really serve a purpose.\nIt’s actually going to end up being counterproductive. If the custom app was developed to streamline processes and make everything more efficient, a clunky user interface would mean that time is wasted when trying to figure out just how to properly use the features.\nThis poses an even greater challenge for commercial apps. User retention will become impossible because once users have been driven away by a bad UX/UI, it’s highly unlikely that they would give the app another chance. They’re already spoilt for choice and it wouldn’t take them two seconds to find an alternative that does what your app is trying to do but better.\nThe word tends to travel fast about apps these days. If the launch of your custom app was hyped up but its implementation turns out to be completely botched, that hype can quickly run any future prospects of success into the ground.\nPeople who were previously looking forward to it or hyping it up on social media would then use their platforms to sound the alarm against the app. It’s very difficult to recover from that kind of negative cover which is why it’s so important that the UX and UI elements are designed with great care.\nGet the best UX/UI design for your app\nBy now, you have realized why both user experience and user interface are important components of app development. It would be a mistake to push ahead with the development of an app without paying due attention to both.\nAllow Zibtek to make this easier for you. As one of the world's leading software development companies, Zibtek has worked with Fortune 500 companies and startups alike, developing custom apps for them that adhere to the best UX and UI design practices.\nIts development team has spent a decade perfecting Zibtek's process of delivering UI and UX services.

Clients are more demanding than ever before since it's so easy now to look up exactly how a company's product or service performs and if it's even worth the money. The internet has put this information at the fingertips of your customers, so it's vital that your business has a robust quality assurance program in place.\nIn addition to helping your company meet the expectations of its clients, a quality assurance program also improves efficiency as it makes it easier to understand which work processes are not performing well and need to be changed. Small gains achieved by this compound over time and have the potential to make a significant impact on your business.\nWhy is Quality Assurance Important?\nThe software development life cycle can be best described as a methodology that includes clearly defined processes that lead to the creation of high-quality software. Professional developers take quality assurance in software very seriously, they think of it as a core component of their development plan.\nPeople who work in these roles are commonly called \"testers\" and their entire job is to ensure that the deliverable meets the client's quality requirements. Workers in the quality assurance role are tasked with making sure that quality is not sacrificed in the development process just to meet deadlines or to complete objectives.\nIt's also during this stage that the developer verifies that the software can do exactly what the customer needs it to do. A test plan is created and the software is put through a variety of test cases. This is done to verify that no unexplained errors exist in the system, that it's bug free and ready to be deployed across the client's systems.\nA solid quality assurance plan helps build the company's credibility as well. Clients know that their work is being done with the utmost care and dedication. This builds a relationship of trust between the client and the developer that can often result in repeat business.\nQuality assurance is an absolute necessity because it's impossible for software to be declared ready for delivery because no bugs were found throughout the entire development process. It just doesn't work that way. Sure, some of the bugs can be insignificant, but that's all the more reason to run the quality assurance gauntlet.\nWhere it fits in the software development life cycle:\nThe International Software Testing Qualifications Board, an organization that offers a standardized qualification for software testers, defines quality assurance as \"part of quality management focused on providing confidence that quality requirements will be fulfilled.\"\nThe scope of quality assurance in the software development life cycle is actually quite broad. It's not merely limited to software testing. Quality assurance is a core component of the entire software development life cycle. The idea here is to ensure that all of the development and maintenance processes are and remain in sync with the clients’ wishes.\nContinuous improvement in the processes can't be possible unless there's no quality assurance which identifies where the weaknesses lie. they can then be corrected to ensure compliance with defined standards. These standards can be one or a combination of multiple standards like ISO15504, ISO 9000, CMMI model and more.\nWhat important services do quality assurance professionals provide?\nSo why is quality assurance important? Product management is one of the most important services that software quality assurance professionals provide. They conduct regular reviews of software to find out how its functionality can be enhanced. That feedback is then relayed to the development team for action.\nQuality assurance professionals also perform the vital task of managing the customer experience. The inherent nature of their job is to be myopically focused on customers and users so they're in a position to view things from the customers' point of view. This gives them a unique perspective on fixing user-facing issues.\nCollaboration with the product development team is also vital to ensuring consistent project execution. These professionals can assist with the identification of KPIs for product quality and offer advice on how to achieve them.\nQuality assurance isn't just a box that needs to be ticked at the end of the software development lifecycle. It needs to be an ongoing exercise so that continuous improvements can be made to achieve better customer satisfaction. People in this role can also help create and manage the overall quality planning strategy.\nSoftware testing for custom app development -- what happens?\nSoftware testing is carried out on custom apps to find out if they meet the required security, usability and functionality standards as set out by the client. Therefore, the custom software is put through its paces so that there are no surprises when it's finally deployed.\nThere are four key testing stages that custom software goes through:\nUnit Testing\nA unit is defined as the smallest testable part of a software. Unit testing is the first stage of a software quality assurance program. It's carried out to find out if all or specific units of the custom app are fully functional as desired.\nUnit testing gives developers a more granular view of how their code is performing. It’s normally considered to be a part of the programming phase since the programmer who wrote the code will normally perform unit testing themselves.\nThis stage can be run every single time a piece of code is changed. It allows the developers to resolve any issues that may arise fairly quickly. Developers tend to perform unit tests before even giving the software to testers for a more formal test.\nIntegration Testing\nIntegration testing involves combining all of the individual units into a program in order to test them collectively. This is done to find out if there are any interface defects between all of the different modules and functions of the custom app.\nIt doesn't matter how efficiently each individual unit performs because if it isn't properly integrated with other units, the overall functionality of the app is negatively impacted.\nThis is a very crucial stage in the quality assurance process. There are multiple approaches to performing integration testing but the end goal always is to check data communication between all of the different units of the custom app.\nSystem Testing\nAt the system testing stage, the completed application is tested as a single unit. This is done to evaluate if all of the requirements have been compiled properly and if the end result meets all of the quality standards.\nThis task is performed by testers who haven't participated in the actual development of the app. It's at this stage that it's discovered whether or not the app meets all of the functional and technical requirements given by the customer.\nNot only the design is evaluated in system testing but the behavior as well. When this test is carried out, it's usually intended to test up to and often beyond what the expectations and hardware or software requirements are.\nAcceptance Testing\nThis is the final stage of the software testing for a custom app. It's performed to figure out if the custom software is ready to be released. Once the testing proves that the app meets all of the requirements and the intended needs of the user, only then can it be released.\nDepending on the nature of the custom app, certain acceptance criteria might be set by the customer. The criteria might include data integrity, data conversion, performance, usability and scalability.\nThis is also the point at which the customer decides if the product is a Go or a No-Go. The developer has to follow the customer's lead on this and if the latter feels the software needs more work, the developer must go back and bring up the software to the customer's expectations.\nFind the right custom software development team.\nWorking with a professional software development team will give you the peace of mind that all of these crucial processes are being strictly followed and that there won’t be any unwanted surprises when the deliverable is ready.\nThe team at Zibtek fits that profile. Zibtek is one of the leading software development companies in the world and has worked with both startups and fortune 500s alike.

While in the end most SMBs find custom software offers more benefits than mass-produced solutions, there are a few downsides worth considering.\nHere’s a look at the pros and cons of outsourcing custom software development for your business.\nBiggest Benefits of Custom Software Development\nAccess to high-quality talent, convenience, and cost-effectiveness are the reasons most businesses cite for outsourcing custom software development. Additional advantages include:\nA Unique & Innovative Product\nIf no two enterprises are exactly alike, it makes sense each company needs software that meets unique business needs. Customized software solutions are designed to align with your business goals while providing your organizations with ample opportunity to grow.\nSuperior Scalability\nNearly every SMB wants to grow its business by creating novel products, services, and processes. In many cases, pre-designed software can’t meet your growth needs, and productivity and functionality suffer as a result. When you attempt to modify off-the-shelf software to accommodate your goals, disruptive bugs and failures often occur. Custom software development is designed to handle business growth in a bug-free manner. You get the specific solutions you need now and can update your custom software for years to come without purchasing new products.\nImproved Productivity\nCustom software comes with far fewer disruptions than ready-made software. Because employees have all the features and capabilities they need, they’re able to work more efficiently and perform their job duties with greater confidence and enjoyment. Work is completed in a shorter amount of time, which is beneficial to your bottom line.\nIncreased Return On Investment\nSome businesses hesitate to invest in custom software development due to a perceived higher cost. It’s true hiring specialists is often more expensive than paying in-house developers, but that’s a short-term vision. Custom software development does tend to cost more upfront, but in the long-term, you receive more in return for your investment. For instance, there’s no need to purchase new or additional hardware, acquire expensive licenses, or pay for features employees will most likely never use.\nEasy Integration\nCustom software development makes it far easier to seamlessly integrate your software with other programs. You can more efficiently update businesses processes and make the shift to cloud and mobile solutions, which gives you a competitive edge in the market and greater efficiency in the workplace.\nOngoing Technical Support\nEven the best built software has the occasional bug or need for an update. With custom software development, you can access continuous support from a team of dedicated IT professionals, minimizing downtime and keeping your business processes running efficiently.\nAs to downsides to outsourcing custom software development, the two greatest disadvantages are the risk of the development company going out of business and communication problems. Lack of control over the project is also a concern, as is security. The key to avoiding these drawbacks is making sure you hire a custom software development company with the experience and expertise you need by asking the right questions.\nWhich Outsource Engagement Model’s Right for You?\nDone right, outsourcing custom software development is your secret weapon for ongoing innovation and sustainable growth. Depending on your needs, you might require one of three different outsource engagement models:\nProject based. Your outsource partner manages the entire project according to your specifications. It oversees the project and delivers a final product to you.\nDedicated team. You get an expert team of developers who work outside your organization. You share ownership of project direction.\nStaff augmentation. You add expert developers to your existing in-house team. You keep full control over the project and save the expense of hiring additional employees.\nNiche-Specific Custom Software Development for Every Industry\nZibtek is equipped to handle whichever engagement model your business needs. We can fully develop your product from start to finish or expand your team to ensure your project stays on track.

Current legal trends are holding companies responsible for US labor forces they may not technically employ but who produce work for them—contractors, third-party employees, etc. We could start seeing this internationally, too, increasing liability for companies who utilize traditional outsourcing. At the same time, companies are also realizing that the lack of control created in many outsourcing arrangements isn’t always good for business. Even as companies are being held legally responsible for their outsourced human resources, many offshore human resource providers are finding better ways to remain outside the legal reach of the client companies they’ve contracted with. Many are the horror stories told to me by clients and colleagues about trying to hold suppliers accountable for project delays, shoddy or error-ridden work, and even complete non-delivery. In countries where courts don’t listen and law enforcement is a mixed bag at best, making sure contracts are fulfilled and seeking recompense when they aren’t is often fruitless. The cost savings of outsourcing are still tremendous when a project is carried off correctly, though, and the efficiency with which quality work can be delivered by a properly managed team of outsourced talent is tantalizing. It’s little wonder many startups and larger companies are torn between the lures of outsourcing and the safety of sticking close to home. With the right touch of insourcing, you can get the best of both worlds—cost savings and security in one.\nDomestic Management, International Talent\nThe simple solution to the outsourcing problem is to make sure there’s an arm of your outsourcing company that’s nearby and that can be held accountable. A company operating right here in the US, for instance, that just happens to have long-standing relationships with software engineers, developers and others who make a great living where they live and who save startups big bucks compared to in-house alternatives. With experienced management here in the US, you get the responsiveness and the accountability you need to feel secure and ensure your deadlines and objectives are respected. With reliable overseas talent, you get quality product turned around quickly without the overhead, hassle, or expense of hiring temporary in-house developers. Outsourcing done right leaves you in complete control of your project, working within legal—and ethical—parameters to achieve cost savings and to get deliverables on the timetable you and your investors need. The problems that others are experiencing, from National Labor Relations Board interference to an inability to get their vendors to cough up the goods, all stem from ceding that control at the beginning. That’s something Zibtek would never ask you to do.\nOutsourcing is Still In, If you Do it Right\nIf you want to learn more about our approach to outsourcing, and why we’re so confident it will work for you just as it’s worked for our past and current clients, please get in touch. We can walk you through the whole outsourcing process and show you just how advantageous a bit of insourced outsourcing can be. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

    "extractedText": "DATABASE\nDatabase Development Processes\nIan J.H Reynolds\nExplore Ian J.H Reynolds' expertise in finance and economics through his insightful articles on market trends, investment strategies, and economic analysis.\nMore posts by Ian J.H Reynolds.\nIAN J.H REYNOLDS\n29 APR 2020 • 7 MIN READ\nDatabase development processes that are well planned out can greatly enhance the efficiency of an organization. Apps generally require a database, which as the name suggests, is a centralized base where all of the data that the app requires is stored. This data can be accessed in various ways by the app and other related systems. A database management system is usually what controls the database.\nIn order to make processing and data querying efficient, the data in most common types of databases is generally modeled into rows and columns. Structured query language or SQL is normally used by most databases for writing and querying data. This allows for easy access, modification and organization of the data.\nAn app without a stable and optimized database at its core will not be able to perform at its full potential. Therefore, this is an important part of the app development process, one that requires as much thought as design and functionality.\nWhat are database development processes?\nAs you now know, the organization's collection of data is what makes up a database. It doesn’t just materialize out of thin air, though. The process actually starts with database design, which requires creating a detailed data model of the database that's to be built.\nThis model includes all logical and physical design patterns that will be utilized to create the database. The data model needs to go into great detail particularly with the requirements for the app and future scalability in mind.\nOnce that's done, the process moves on to the actual database development. By then, it's only a matter of bringing the database design to life and developing it according to the schema specifications. Design standards must be followed precisely so as to limit the chances of data anomalies.\nAnother important consideration when designing a database is access time. For example, if a complex query needs to be accessed frequently, the database needs to be designed in a certain way to allow that to happen in order to optimize the overall performance.\nWhere does database development fit in the software development lifecycle?\nAt its very core, software engineering divides database development processes up into a series of phases. Each phase focuses on one particular aspect of the development, this entire series is what's called the software development life cycle.\nAn app will go through this entire lifecycle when it's being brought to life from a mere concept and it may go through the lifecycle multiple times, depending upon how frequently it's redeveloped and refined further with additional functionality.\nDatabase development is an integral part of the development stage of the life cycle. Typically, a life cycle model includes planning, requirements, design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance. These phases are defined very broadly and may vary for certain kinds of applications, but generally the work proceeds in this manner.\nDatabase development processes should be done step by step.\nMuch like the software development life cycle, database development is very much a process-based system. This “waterfall” process has five main steps that developers follow when executing a project.\nOne of the first things they do is sit down with the client to understand what their requirements are and what sort of functionality they’re looking to get out of their app. This helps them form a clearer picture of what’s required of them, how much time it will take to complete the project and what it might end up costing the client.\nOnce there is an understanding between the client and the developer and the I’s have been dotted and the T’s have been crossed, work begins and follows the process as detailed below. It largely remains the same regardless of the type of app that’s being developed, since database development is at the core of it all.\nWhat is needed at all stages of the process of developing a database system?\nThorough Planning\nOne of the first stages of database development is planning. Without adequate planning, it can't be guaranteed that the work will deliver optimal results. Therefore, it's vital that the framework and the requirements of the database being developed are determined first.\nThis is also important because it's only in the planning stage that you'll find out whether the scope of this database project will permit it being completed within the timeline without exceeding the budget.\nWhat resources would be required for the job and the allocation of people and budgets is carried out during this stage. All of the people who are to work on the project are notified about their responsibilities and targets.\nRequirement Analysis\nThis can be considered as an extension of the planning phase as it entails a more detailed examination of just how the database development needs to be performed. The idea here is to look at the requirement and expectation of the client and ascertain how much of that can be achieved.\nThis step requires the database designers to interview the clients and obtain functional requirements from them. For the database development process to be a success, there needs to be agreement among all parties involved because there would just be too much unnecessary back and forth if they're not on the same page.\nThe functional requirements aren't really meant to explain how the data is going to be processed. It's basically a guideline for the developers so that they know what the data items are and what attributes they possess. This also helps them understand the relationships between different data items.\nDesign\nThis is one of the most critical steps in the database development lifecycle. All of the work that was carried out in the earlier phases comes to the fore here. Everything done during the planning and the analysis stage is implemented at the design stage.\nThis is the part where developers actually design the database. It's usually going through the trial and error phase at this stage so it's not uncommon for developers to provide clients access to the new database on a limited basis. This is done to form an assessment of the function and to figure out if any changes need to be made to the plan in order to achieve the stated goals.\nThe output at the design stage is the logical schema of all the data tables and constraints based on the conceptual data model. It's also decided at this stage which tables will be used for representing data in the database.\nImplementation and deployment\nAfter the specification of the logical schema has been defined in the previous stage, then comes implementation, which involves the construction of the actual database. Implementation heavily relies upon the choice of available database tools, operating environment and the database managed systems.\nThe database management system can be installed on a new server if need be, or on existing servers. Virtualization is a new trend that's increasingly being used for the management systems. It involves creating logical representations of the computing resources that can be deployed independent of the underlying physical computing resources.\nOnce implementation is done, the database undergoes a series of tests to evaluate its performance, security and integrity. Any further fine-tuning that may be required is then carried out. Finally, the database is deployed.\nMaintenance\nThe process doesn’t end when the database has been deployed. To ensure that it keeps functioning as needed, regular maintenance needs to be carried out on the database, particularly if there are scalability challenges.\nThe database administrator is tasked with performing routine maintenance activities. They can include preventive maintenance which requires backing up the data or corrective maintenance which deals with the recovery of data.\nAdditional work may also be carried out to improve the performance of the database as well as for managing access permissions for users. If there happens to be a major issue with the database platform somewhere down the line, the administrator will also need to rebuild the database and put it through the implementation and testing phases once again.\nGet app developers who understand the database development process.\nIt goes without saying that your mobile app project can’t be a success until you’ve got developers onboard who understand database development and know just how important it is in ensuring that your app delivers optimal functionality.\nThis is why it’s essential to work with developers who are not only skilled in the conceptualization, design and development of applications but can also perform this crucial task. Your developer should be able to provide a one-stop solution, instead of having you find a separate resource for database development.\nNo wonder Zibtek is preferred by companies ranging from Fortune 500s to startups for app development. It has over a decade's worth of experience in app development, building everything from custom ERP-integrated mobile experiences to education apps.\nZibtek is based in the United States with offices in Salt Lake, Utah. It also has a global talent pool of developers, all managed from within the United States, that are experts in iOS and Android development with proficiency in React native, Phonegap and hybrid development. Their team understands the importance of database development and has the necessary skills to bring apps of any complexity to reality. Contact the team at Zibtek today to find out how they can take care of database development for you.\nWhat are some common database development tools?\nSome common tools used in database development include database management systems (DBMS) such as MySQL, Oracle RDBMS, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server.\nHow can a well-designed database benefit an organization?\nA well-designed database can benefit an organization by providing a structured and efficient way to store and retrieve data. This can lead to improved productivity, as employees no longer have to spend time manually tracking and organizing data. A well-designed database can also improve the accuracy of data, as it can be designed to enforce rules and constraints to ensure that only valid data is entered into the system.\nHow can database indexing improve database performance?\nDatabase indexing can improve database performance by allowing for faster search and retrieval of data. This is because an index creates a separate data structure that stores the values for a specific column or set of columns, and the database software can use this data structure to quickly locate the desired data.

Now, this has helped the end-users to sidestep some of the key hurdles that one can associate with software implementation and software maintenance.\nNow, some of the significant problems that we were able to overcome are things like the difficulties in the installation process, upgrades of the software, testing, and training that is streamlined and also minimizing substantial upfront costs related to these.\nWithout a doubt, SaaS trends are evolving further still. Nowadays, it is quite fascinating to see artificial intelligence and machine learning dominating the SaaS conversation. It is a fact that almost all the prominent analysts think that AI is the next big shift in the market today.\nUndoubtedly, AI has now become an integral part of the evolution. Here are some ways or methods SaaS companies can employ to take advantage of the disruption that will occur in the market in the coming few months or years.\nNo 1: SaaS Automation\nAI essentially aggregates enormous quantities of data. In most cases, It is used on customer data. You need to distill it into an automatic process that is typically accompanied by humans. SaaS decision makers are well aware that there needs to be a lot of effort, Intel, and workforce in place, to help customers to engage well with the product. It is necessary for you to understand that over a period, the needs of the customers keep changing. AI enables SaaS companies not only to refine the customer experience process but in most cases also to automate them.\nThings that you can automate include items such as training, onboarding, and marketing campaigns, as well as ongoing customer service. Chatbots are the customer service AI platforms, and they are instrumental to not only respond to but also to troubleshoot most of the customer’s inquiries automatically. According to industry experts, this has enabled customer service departments to take on customers queries at up to 30 to 40% increased volume.\nNow, this is great news when it comes to revenue retention and reduction of customer churn. 42 percent of the customers are more willing to purchase a product after they had a positive experience. Experts at Zendesk conducted a study to derive this figure. But, the bad news is that one bad customer experience can drive your customers away. That’s a quite startling figure.\nThe best way to obtain a seamless cross-section, convenience, problem-solving and human experience is to supplement your customer service team with AI technology. You will not regret choosing this option.\nNo 2: Customize It\nMost customers these days want to have personal experience that one can tailor to their unique needs. If your business is not going to provide this, they will choose another company that can do it. It is vital for you to understand that your users might not get impressed because of a few new features that you add on to your application or the interface if it can’t be customized to suit their individual needs.\nNo doubt, this can muddle up the whole customer experience. Besides providing email campaigns and other vital communication that is individualized, AI supports various other features now such as voice control and natural language processing. The best thing about AI is that it can closely track the behavior of each user in an endeavor to customize the functionality better to a particular set of preferences. This hyper-targeting will also support customer loyalty amidst growing competition.\nNo 3: Predictive Analysis\nUndoubtedly, this is the most vital of all the artificial intelligence capabilities that are available. Machine learning not only empowers the companies with information that is essential to understand what a customer is doing now to what he may do in the future. It can do this because it can combine the historical data with the most advanced analytics to both track and form specific patterns.\nIt will help companies know what customers will do next. Now, this might include things such as opening an email, purchasing a new product that you are offering, subscribing or disengaging from your brand altogether. Having this data in hand is essential as it can help you in personalizing your marketing communications better. You can also segment and refine your customer database better.\nPredictive analysis can also help you to customize the user experience so that customers can make a better decision in the buying cycle. Using an active approach instead of a reactive approach is always good. It will significantly help you in identifying the customer needs even before they can recognize them.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, it is necessary for you to understand that AI is right now still early in development, and its long-term application is not here yet. However, if your company is looking towards the future, you need to put in some efforts to research the intelligence available and invest appropriately for future disruption. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

    "extractedText": "JAVA\nJava Reactive Programming: Everything You Need to Know\nIan J.H Reynolds\nExplore Ian J.H Reynolds' expertise in finance and economics through his insightful articles on market trends, investment strategies, and economic analysis.\nMore posts by Ian J.H Reynolds.\nIAN J.H REYNOLDS\n10 NOV 2020 • 6 MIN READ\nThere’s no one size fits all approach to programming. Developers have a variety of platforms and languages available to them. It’s up to them to ascertain which particular framework or language is best suited for the project that they’re working on.\nThey can also choose from many of the different programming models to streamline their process.\nThese models or paradigms have their own strengths and weaknesses. However, it's known that anything that's solvable using one of the paradigms can also be solved using others.\nThat doesn't take away from the fact that certain problems may be better suited to specific models.\nWhat is reactive programming?\nA simple definition for reactive programming can be hard to come by. That's because there's a lack of good informative material on the subject. The few definitions that are available are either too complex or too vague to provide newcomers to the subject any clarity on the matter.\nReactive programming can simply be described as programming with asynchronous data streams. A stream can be best described as a sequence of ongoing events ordered in time.\nThe idea itself isn't new, as conventional click events are basically an asynchronous event stream, but reactive programming is taking it to an entirely different level.\nIt enables developers to create data streams of anything, not confining them to just hover or click events. Anything can be made a stream, including but not limited to caches, data structures, variables, user inputs, and more.\nThe biggest challenge for developers is to think in reactive. They have to let go of the muscle memory that they have formed with the typical methods of programming. They need to force their brain to think in a different paradigm.\nWith reactive programming, developers can utilize a variety of powerful functions to create, combine, and filter any of these streams. For example, they can use one stream as an input for another one. Multiple streams can be used as an input for another stream. The possibilities are endless here.\nAdvantages of reactive programming\nSimple to compose streams of data\nAs previously highlighted, perhaps one of the biggest advantages of reactive programming is just how easily it makes for developers to compose streams of data. Streams can emit a value, error, and a completed signal.\nThese emitted events are captured asynchronously and functions are defined that execute when a value, error or completed signal is emitted. With reactive programming, developers are able to create, filter, and combine these streams to achieve powerful objectives.\nHighly interactive apps\nSince reactive programming raises the level of abstraction of the code, it enables the developers to focus more on the interdependence of events that define the business logic. They no longer have to constantly deal with a large amount of implementation details.\nThe benefits of this are evident in modern mobile and web apps that are highly interactive with a large collection of UI events related to data events. With reactive programming, apps are able to achieve more in real-time, improving the user experience in the process.\nAvoid “callback hell”\nAsk any developer about callback hell and they’ll tell you that it’s something they want to avoid at all costs. It's another name for the long nesting of asynchronous functions.\nThis problem can occur quite frequently when there are a lot of callback functions in the code. The problem is further exacerbated by functions like do loops and try-catch blocks.\nThat's because code that was written in the traditional synchronous style can't be delayed. The only way to delay a computation for it to run after the asynchronous call has returned is to put the delayed code inside a callback function.\nThis just results in nested callbacks everywhere. Developers can avoid the callback hell with reactive programming as it relies on asynchronous data streams.\nDisadvantages of reactive programming\nMight be difficult to learn for some\nReactive programming does have a reputation of being difficult so some developers might struggle with learning it initially.\nWith time, they should be able to get comfortable with the idea of reactive programming, but going past the initial block could prove to be frustrating for a lot of people.\nThe fact that everything needs to be an asynchronous stream further adds to this challenge. Developers who are not used to working with this paradigm will struggle to hit the ground running.\nLack of good educational resources\nEven those who are willing to tough it out and learn reactive programming, they will be disappointed by the lack of good education resources on the subject. The available information is either all too complex or too generic and much of it may not make a lot of sense to someone who’s just starting out.\nMore memory intensive\nSince reactive programming is based on streams over time, applications will tend to be more memory intensive. That's because of the simple fact that all of the different streams of data need to be stored. That can prove to be a problem if computing resources are limited.\nHow does reactive programming work with Java?\nThere's benefits of using reactive programming with Java. It allows Java apps to exhibit higher performance with lower memory requirements. This is made possible by avoiding blocking calls that lead to a process as well as context switches in the OS.\nReactive programming works in Java by relying on the data streams that form the backbone of the app. They communicate the calls, messages, events and failures.\nReactive programming allows for these streams to be observed and then to react when a value is emitted. Developers can create streams of anything that can change in the code like cache events or clicks to make the app asynchronous.\nThere are different libraries that can be used to enable reactive programming in a Java app. Microsoft's Reactive Extensions is one of them. It's used by Netflix developers for the streaming service's web application.\nReactive vs. imperative programming with Java\nReactive and imperative programming paradigms are fundamentally different. Java is primarily an imperative language, in that it's solely focused on achieving the final result by pulling an event off of a queue. Reactive programming registers a callback and the framework is responsible for calling that callback correctly.\nIn the imperative paradigm, the code is executed based on the statements that detail every single step that the program has to do before the task can be completed. Data is being pulled in imperative programming while it's being pushed in reactive.\nStatements are used in the imperative paradigm to change a program's state. It lists the commands that the computer needs to perform in order to complete the task. This defines how the program needs to operate. The code is only executed in order statement by statement.\nReactive programming is different because it relies entirely on asynchronous data streams. These streams can be changed, created or combined on the fly. The execution is not done in order as it’s no longer based on arrays but on streams.\nIn most implementations, both reactive and imperative paradigms are required. Writing business logic is easier in imperative style while the reactive paradigm is better suited to event handling.\nDevelopers can thus write the app's code in the imperative style but use the reactive style to perform select functions.\nPut Java reactive programming to use in your custom software\nThere's a lot of value to be had by using Java reactive programming in your custom software solution. It's highly effective for apps that have to deal with multiple users and high load.\nJava reactive programming is the ideal solution for load balancers, proxy servers, artificial intelligence and machine learning, real-time data streaming, highly interactive UI elements, and more.\nJava is the right choice if you're looking for custom software development that's secure, robust, fast, and scalable.\nAt Zibtek, we have over 10 years of experience with creating successful Java projects for a variety of clients ranging from Fortune 500 companies to startups.

Custom medical software development is an industry in its own right because of the increasing reliance that both hospitals and patients place on it.\nMedical professionals rely on custom software to keep track of patients’ treatment courses. They can have quick access to patients’ reports and other relevant information to make informed decisions about their treatment.\nCustom medical software is also crucial for hospitals. They need to have robust systems in place to track everything from medications to staff assignments. The software can make the process much simpler and also ensure accurate record keeping.\nPatients benefit from medical software as well. They get the ability to monitor their own medical analytics data. Third-party apps and services also provide them with the ability to measure their vitals using smart devices and share the data with their doctor as and when required.\nWhat is medical software development?\nMedical software development can be best described as the process of developing custom software for medical professionals and patients. This can be in the form of mobile or web apps as well as custom software systems that work across a variety of platforms and devices.\nCustom software for the medical industry can include admin dashboards, patient engagement software, data analysis tools, telemedicine and telehealth apps, remote patient monitoring systems, and more. The objective to improve patient care while increasing efficiency for caregivers.\nWhat kind of software is used in healthcare?\nHospital inventory management\nThis is one of the most commonly used custom medical software in the industry. Hospitals need to keep track of many different things and the only way to effectively remain on top of things is to use inventory management software.\nThere's another benefit to using such a system which is particularly useful for the supervision of drugs and medical supplies. It helps the hospital improve the efficiency of the supply chain and also reduce medical waste.\nThe data collected from the software can also be used to forecast demand for medications, control distribution, track stock levels, order placement, automated expiration date control, and more.\nPatient portals\nPatients have a right to access their medical information. Instead of giving them mountains of print outs that detail their blood work or countless imaging films, hospitals rely on patient portals to conveniently and securely provide patients with access to their personal health information.\nThrough the portal, the patients can get a complete overview of their history, lab test results, treatment procedures, and relevant educational material. They can also use the portal to schedule appointments, view a detailed history of their hospital visits, fill pre-visit forms online, and receive automated reminders for their visit.\nThe portals can also allow for secure communication between the doctor and the patient in addition to video consultations. Furthermore, the portals can be utilized for accessing the complete billing history, online payment of bills, details on insurance coverage, requests for prescription refills, and more.\nTelemedicine and telehealth apps\nThe ubiquity of smartphones has enabled medical professionals to provide telemedicine and telehealth services to patients in remote areas. This has enabled patients who may not be in the vicinity of a healthcare provider to receive assistance through their mobile devices.\nThe need for such apps has been further highlighted by the pandemic that has forced people to stay indoors. To ensure the safety of both doctors and patients, a lot of outpatient work has been done this year through telemedicine apps.\nThese apps have proven to be crucial to the healthcare industry in the pandemic year. Those who would have otherwise lost access to their doctor simply because it was unsafe for them to visit a hospital for even a regular consultation were able to get the treatment they need from the safety of their own home.\nData analytics\nHealthcare providers have to balance the provision of quality care to patients while also keeping a close eye on their bottom line. Effective management of their operations is not possible without a robust analytics tool.\nMany hospitals prefer to get their own custom analytics tools developed that can accommodate their established processes as well as any evolution in the care environment.\nMedical software development standards, explained\nIEC 62304 is a functional safety standard titled \"medical device software - software lifecycle processes.\" Developers are required to comply with the standard as it covers the safe design and maintenance of software. The standard details all of the tasks, activities, and processes that need to be followed in order to ensure software safety.\nThe IEC 82304 standard highlights the general requirements for the safety and security of health software products that are designed for general computing platforms and to be distributed without dedicated hardware.\nDevelopers are required to perform a preliminary risk assessment at a system level so that the system requirements can be written with regard to the risk assessment. Mitigation actions need to be defined in the system requirements to minimize risks.\nSafeguarding patient data is also crucial which is why medical software needs to be HIPAA-compliant. HIPAA or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act lays down the standards for the protection of sensitive medical data.\nCompanies that have access to protected health information are required to have a physical network and adequate process security measures to ensure compliance. There are access control requirements as well, in that only authorized personnel can have access to protected health information.\nThey include the provision of unique user IDs, procedures for emergency access, automatic log-off, encryption, and decryption in addition to tracking logs and activity logs on hardware and software.\nRobust recovery systems and offsite backups are essential as well so that any errors or failures can be quickly rectified and no protected health information is leaked or lost.\nHow important is it to have updated medical software?\nThe importance of having updated medical software can’t be highlighted enough. Healthcare providers have a great responsibility on their shoulders to first and foremost ensure the safety of patients’ protected health information.\nWith cybersecurity threats increasing, there’s a greater need now than ever before to have updated medical software that offers protection against threats. The healthcare industry continues to be a target for cybercriminals.\nThere have been cases where hospitals have lost access to their systems due to ransomware, which is malware that's designed to compromise the integrity of the system and only returns access when a ransom is paid.\nThese risks go far beyond the leak of patients' data. Hospitals that have their entire systems crippled due to a cyberattack are often unable to provide patient care. This can literally become a matter of life and death for patients, and as such, open up the healthcare provider to liability.\nThat is why updated medical software is so critical and beyond offering protection against possible cyberattacks, it also provides a more intuitive user experience. Patients don’t want to deal with clunky apps or portals that look like they belong in the 1990s.\nThey’re used to well-designed apps that offer seamless access to the information they’re looking for. Therefore, it’s best to utilize the latest software development methodologies to create custom medical software that both patients and medical professionals would like to use.\nHow developers create custom medical software for healthcare organizations\nDevelopers approach any custom medical software development work with the utmost care. The primary concern is always to ensure compliance with development standards. Only then can the client have the peace of mind that the software they have invested in will not run foul of the regulators.\nSoftware development firms will often depute their most skilled resources on the job since medical software development requires a greater level of care. This is done to minimize risks and to provide clients with the assurance that they are getting the best that the firm has to offer.\nBefore starting on the project, the developers will seek to form a deep understanding of the client’s requirements for the software. Whether they need it to work on just one mobile platform or multiple, if they have interoperability requirements, etc.\nThis will provide them with a complete picture of what needs to be done so that they can create a plan on how to proceed accordingly.\nMedical software development should only be trusted by highly skilled developers that have experience in the field. Zibtek has been a trusted partner of medical organizations and healthcare providers for decades.\nZibtek is one of the world’s leading software development firms with offices in Salt Lake City, Utah.

You can now purchase anything from groceries to cars from the comfort of your own home. All it takes now is just a few taps on your smartphone. Never before have we experienced the sort of convenience that the internet has provided us with.\nHow do the companies that offer these goods and services online accept payments, though? A seamless payment system is crucial to making the online shopping experience worthwhile for customers. Not only does it need to be seamless, but it also needs to be secure.\nThat is where payment gateways come in. They take care of the entire payment processing operation for the online store. There are several key tasks that payment processes handle in order to securely process payments for merchants.\nWhat is a payment gateway, and how does it work?\nA payment gateway is a service provided to merchants that are looking for a solution to process payments online. The vast majority of online stores tend to opt for popular payment gateways instead of obtaining their own merchant acquiring accounts and processing software.\nDoing that can be highly capital intensive, not to mention the fact that it also places additional responsibility on the merchant to ensure the security of their customers’ payment details.\nThere's a core difference between payment gateways and payment processors that needs to be understood. A payment processor takes the payment information that the customer enters into the online store and transmits it to the issuing bank.\nA payment gateway does the same, but it goes one step further by also authorizing the transfer of funds between the buyer and the seller.\nA payment gateway works by first encrypting the confidential credit or debit card details that the customer enters. This is done to ensure that the information can be transmitted securely between the customer and the acquiring bank through the merchant.\nIt also validates the payment information that's provided, checks whether funds are actually available, and transmits the issuing bank's acceptance or rejection of the transaction back to the customer.\nThe most popular payment gateways\nPayPal\nPayPal is without a doubt one of the most widely used and recognized payment gateways in the world. Many actually know it as a redirect payment gateway as many merchants prefer to just send customers to a PayPal-hosted checkout since they find that it boosts trust in the transaction.\nMerchants also prefer PayPal because it's relatively easy to get up and running with it. Once they have it configured, they can accept payments through major card issuers including Visa, Mastercard, and Amex. It's also possible to accept payments through mobile payment solutions.\nPayPal actually got its start in 1998 back when the company was called Confinity. Its initial focus wasn't on payments but that's what the company ended up pivoting to.\neBay ended up acquiring the company in 2002 and later spun it off as a separate entity in 2015. It now allows merchants in more than 200 countries and territories to accept payments online.\nStripe\nStripe is one of the fastest-growing payment gateways in the market today. It has several key differentiating features that make it one of the go-to choices for online entrepreneurs looking for a payments solution. The company is focused on catering primarily to the eCommerce segment with highly competitive processing fees.\nIt offers merchants a very advanced software suite. The data that they can get from that allows them to further improve their conversion rates. Stripe prides itself on being a developer-friendly solution as that provides merchants with a lot of flexibility when it comes to customizing the checkout experience.\nStripe is a relatively new company as it was founded in 2010. It's only available to merchants in about two dozen countries at the moment and is primarily used by merchants in North America and Europe.\nStripe also offers a point-of-sale solution to businesses called the Terminal so that they can accept cards at retail outlets through a physical card reader.\nAuthorize.net\nAuthorize.net is a preferred payment gateway for small-to-medium-sized businesses. It provides them with the ability to accept a wide variety of payment methods, including but not limited to checks and mobile payments.\nIt also provides support for recurring billing. With custom checkout pages, businesses can exercise control over the checkout process by offering customers branded checkout.\nAuthorize.net was founded back in 1996 and it was acquired by Visa, the globally renowned card issuer, in 2010. The company provides merchants with fraud protection services, simple checkout options, an API, and SDKs for development.\nHow can I integrate a payment gateway onto my website?\nIt's very important to have a seamless checkout experience for your online store. Studies have shown that most customers tend to abandon websites that seem to have a complicated checkout process or if they have doubts about the security of their payment information.\nThe proper integration of a payment gateway on your website will ensure that customers who might be on the fence about proceeding with the purchase have the peace of mind to continue with the transaction.\nHosted or redirect payment gateways like PayPal take customers from your website to their payment processing page once the customer clicks on the purchase button.\nThe process usually involves creating a payment button through the gateway’s integration tools and adding them to the website.\nThe integration process for non-hosted gateways, those that execute the entire transaction on the merchant’s own website, is fairly complex. There are additional security considerations that must be taken into account.\nFor example, to integrate with the Autorize.net API, a sandbox account needs to be created with merchant authorization.\nThe requests are then sent over the HTTP Post method to the API endpoint URLs. The different integration methods for Authorize.net include Direct Post, Server Integration, Advanced Integration, and Simple Checkout.\nOnce the integration has been completed, it’s always a good idea to execute a test transaction. This will provide the peace of mind that everything is working as it should be and that there won’t be any unforeseen issues when the online store goes live.\nThe last thing that an online business needs are issues with their payment gateway when their online store goes live. Usually, the launch is aided by significant marketing spend and all of that can quickly go down the drain if the online store isn’t able to properly process payments for the orders.\nHow much does a payment gateway integration cost?\nAll of the payment gateways have their own fee structure for providing you with the ability to take payments online. PayPal, one of the largest gateways, currently charges 2.9% plus an extra $0.30 per transaction. Stripe also charges 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction and so does Authorize.net.\nMerchants have to include this cost in their pricing as they are required to pay these charges on every single transaction. These costs can vary as well. Many payment gateways offer bespoke pricing to merchants that cross a processing threshold. This is done to encourage larger merchants to stick with the gateway.\nOther variables are also a factor when figuring out the payment gateway integration cost. Some gateways charge a minimum fee unless a certain number of transactions are not done in a calendar month.\nThis can be tough on small businesses that are just starting out because they have to pay a set amount every month even if they’re not doing a lot of volume. Gateways can also have extra fees on transactions paid for using cards that are issued outside the merchant’s country, for example.\nMerchants that sell their products globally might also have to take a hit on the exchange rate. While payment gateways are capable of handling transactions in most major currencies, if the merchant requires all of their transactions to be processed in a particular currency, then they will need to take a hit on the exchange rate.\nFind the right developer to help customers pay for your products and services online\nThere are many different things to keep in mind when opting for a payment gateway for your online store. You need to understand whether the gateway that you’re considering has any minimum fee or if they provide volume discounts, something that can help you save money in the long run when you scale up.\nYou also need to work with development partners that are highly experienced when it comes to integrating payment gateways. That level of experience is necessary to limit the possibility of any cybersecurity issues.\nZibtek has long been a trusted partner of companies that want to accept payments online for their goods and services. We can guide you on what gateways will best suit your business needs. Our team of highly skilled developers will also work with you to ensure the proper integration of the payment gateway on your store. Have any questions about how we can help?

    "extractedText": "UI DESIGN\nWhat Is UI Scale?\nIan J.H Reynolds\nExplore Ian J.H Reynolds' expertise in finance and economics through his insightful articles on market trends, investment strategies, and economic analysis.\nMore posts by Ian J.H Reynolds.\nIAN J.H REYNOLDS\n8 DEC 2020 • 6 MIN READ\nThe user interface is without a doubt one of the most important components of a modern app. It’s the touchpoint between the user and the service that your business is providing them. Therefore, exceptional care should be taken when designing the user interface.\nHow intuitive your user interface is depends on many different factors. What business owners need to realize, though, is that they need to make sure that it feels natural and intuitive. A clunky UI isn’t going to get them anywhere and it actually has a higher chance of turning users away from the product.\nThat’s obviously an outcome that most business owners would want to avoid. There are a number of ways through which it’s possible to achieve a user interface that’s highly appreciated by users.\nWhat is UI Scale?\nWith users relying on so many devices these days, apps can’t take a one-size-fits-all approach to their user interface. It’s imperative for developers to ensure that the app looks and feels natural on devices with all screen sizes.\nNothing is worse than seeing the UI of an app all stretched out on a device that has a display size larger than what the app is optimized for. This leads to a drop in the user experience and raises the possibility of the user never coming back to the app again.\nFortunately, modern operating systems make it very easy to scale up the UI, so developers don’t have to write the code from scratch for every individual screen size that they wish to support.\nGoogle's Android OS, for example, provides a way to scale up the UI on the whole system. Even game development engines like Unity have a relevant component that allows for the game UI layouts to support a wide variety of different screen resolutions and layouts.\nUI Scale is what enables users to enlarge aspects of the user interface like the text and graphics when they appear too small due to a resolution discrepancy. It will uniformly scale GUI objects to suit the screen resolution.\nHow is UI scale used in web development\nWeb development presents complex issues of design. Something that designers have to keep in mind when starting out is the physical size of the screen as well as the resolution. They must have an understanding of what sizes to design for and exactly how the design that they create will look on those screens.\nThe most common screen resolution over the years has been 1024 x 768 but it's not of much relevance today as it used to be. That's because of the simple fact that the devices that people use to consume the majority of their online content have changed significantly over the past few years.\nTo ensure that users get a consistent experience across desktop and mobile devices, developers now prefer response web design as the solution to the screen size challenges.\nThe idea here is to move away from using fixed-width websites and rely on media queries in CSS instead. This creates websites that respond in size to the different viewports of devices, no matter of how big or small their screens may be, to provide the best possible user experience to the visitor.\nSince mobile traffic now accounts for the bulk of global online traffic, developers absolutely have to pay attention to how mobile friendly their web app would look from the get go. Google also ranks websites that have a responsive design favorably.\nDifferent approaches to creating UIs in custom apps\nCreating UIs for custom apps is a delicate task. The rate of adoption for an app is directly related to how good it's user interface is. In an era of sleek and intuitive apps, an app with a clunky user interface instantly stands out and develops a reputation of not being good enough.\nThere are many different user interface design tools that strive to make it easier for developers to create modern and responsive UIs for their custom apps. Flutter is one of them. It's a free and open-source mobile UI framework from Google.\nFlutter enables developers to create native mobile apps with one codebase. This means that they can create apps for both iOS and Android devices by using just one programming language and codebase.\nThe Flutter Framework consists of a UI Library that's based on widgets. It provides developers with a large collection of reusable UI elements like sliders, buttons, and text inputs that they can use in their apps. These elements can be further personalized for a more customized look and feel.\nFluid UI is another solution that's widely used for designing the user interface for custom apps. It offers a comprehensive collection of pre-built UI kits for Android, iOS, web apps, and more.\nDevelopers can prototype in high or low fidelity depending on the style they prefer. The prototypes can be created quickly and shared. It's also possible to visually link prototypes together. Feedback, collaboration, and sharing are all built into Fluid UI.\nProto.io is another widely used approach for creating the user interface of a custom app. It aims to make the process easier for developers by offering them with many design and prototype templates. That also makes it easy to use since no coding is required to create the prototypes.\nAnother benefit of this solution is that it allows you to import UI components from Photoshop. Proto.io has additional features like the ability to create animations that show the flow of the app across different screens. This comes in handy when the app is meant to work on devices with varying screen sizes.\nMany developers also prefer BuildFire. It's an end-to-end app development platform that offers powerful functionality for mobile app developers. They can easily create a prototype of the app that they're designing. BuildFire provides customizable functionality for more personalized components, fonts, colors, and more. A fully functioning app can thus be designed with this tool that can work across both iOS and Android mobile platforms.\nGet a developer who can scale your UI the way you want\nBy now, you have come to realize just how important the user interface is to a custom app. In this day and age, the user interface alone can make or break a web app or mobile app. That’s because it’s the first thing that users judge when they’re using a new app.\nSo if the user interface isn’t good enough or if it looks outdated, chances are that the user won’t be coming back. There’s also the risk of generating a negative perception for the app because that user won’t likely be recommending your app to people in their circle.\nThat’s why it’s so important to make sure that the user interface you develop for your app takes in mind the latest trends, user preferences as well as suitability for the particular niche that it’s in. All of these things must be thoroughly researched before the work actually begins.\nNot everyone will be able to create the kind of user interface that you’re looking for. You will need to work with highly skilled developers that are capable of bringing your vision for the app to life. There will be many who claim they’re capable but will fall short of expectations.\nThe developer that you need to work with should have ample knowledge of the latest trends in user interface design. They should also be highly proficient in the core development work. The UI alone isn’t everything. You also need to ensure that the app’s features work as they are supposed to.\nLook no further than Zibtek. We’re one of the world’s leading software development companies with over a decade of experience. We have worked with clients from both Fortune 500 companies and startups alike, helping them bring their ideas to life.\nWe have experienced user interface and user experience developers on our team who can leverage their experience to enhance the interaction between your target customers and your digital brand.\nOur UI design process includes references, the entire graphic interface, animation prototypes, complete UI guidelines and kit in addition to the final review to ensure that everything is exactly how you want it to be.\nWe also take great care to be sure that the user interface for your custom app scales appropriately for any device and screen size used to access it. This is done so that your users always have a consistent experience no matter what device they use to access your custom app.\nZibtek is based in the United States with offices in Salt Lake City, Utah.

    "extractedText": "WEB DEVELOPMENT\nWebSockets and Load Balancers: How to Use Them\nIan J.H Reynolds\nExplore Ian J.H Reynolds' expertise in finance and economics through his insightful articles on market trends, investment strategies, and economic analysis.\nMore posts by Ian J.H Reynolds.\nIAN J.H REYNOLDS\n22 NOV 2020 • 6 MIN READ\nHow do you effectively manage traffic on your network, particularly in situations when there’s a huge spike? Effective management is vital in these situations because the failure to do so can result in the entire network crashing. This can lock your visitors and customers out and cause some serious harm to your business.\nThat’s why it’s so important to not only understand the concept of load balancing but to also utilize it. Load balancing refers to the act of distributing network traffic across multiple services.\nThis makes sure that there's not too much load on a single server which could cause it to crash.\nThere are many benefits to utilizing load balancing. When the load is distributed across multiple services, it helps improve the responsiveness of your application. It also limits the chances of servers crashing as they're not being subjected to loads beyond what they're capable of withstanding.\nHow does load balancing work?\nA group of backend servers is referred to as a server pool or server farm. A load balancer's job is to distribute incoming network traffic across them. Load balancers work by routing all incoming traffic requests to all of the servers that are capable of handling a large amount of concurrent requests.\nThis is done to ensure maximum speed and capacity utilization. Even if a server ends up going down, the load balancer will automatically redirect traffic to the remaining servers that are still online.\nWhen that server is brought back up online, the load balancer will intelligently add it to the pool and send requests accordingly.\nThere are many different load balancing algorithms that provide different benefits. Businesses choose the ones that are best suited to their use cases.\nFor example, an IP Hash algorithm uses the IP address of the visitor to determine which server receives the request. The Round Robin algorithm, on the other hand, distributes the requests across the entire group of servers sequentially.\nWhat is WebSocket?\nWebSockets or the WebSocket API is best described as an advanced technology that enables two-way interactive communication between a user's web browser and the server. This API enables the browser to send messages to the server and receive event-driven responses. It makes this happen without having to poll the server for a reply.\nThis full-duplex, bidirectional communications channel that WebSockets provides operates over HTTP and a single TCP/IP socket connection. The need for WebSockets arose due to the limitations of HTTP which required polling of the server. Even long-polling would keep resources on the server tied up throughout the duration of the long-poll.\nThere's no such limitation with WebSockets. Message-based data can be sent without having to poll the server. HTTP is only used as the primary transport mechanism while the TCP connection is kept active so that it can be used to send messages between the browser and the server.\nHow to scale WebSockets\nVertical scaling\nVertical scaling is perhaps one of the easiest ways to scale an app since it primarily requires the addition of more resources. So in order to scale up, all you need to do is add more machines so that more power is at your disposal.\nThe single instance of the application is kept as is while more hardware resources like CPU, additional memory, faster IO, etc are utilized to improve performance.\nAs you can probably imagine, it's not the most effective scaling solution. It's also more cost intensive since adding more compute resources will require more money. That doesn't change the fact that the code execution time isn't changing linearly even with the improved hardware.\nHorizontal Scaling\nHorizontal scaling doesn't require more resources, but it needs additional instances of the app. It makes dynamic scaling possible as well in which instances are added and removed based on the current load.\nScaling WebSockets isn't as simple as just increasing the number of instances. It needs to be configured with some other tools in order to build a fully scalable architecture.\nUsing a Publish/Subscribe or pub/sub broker is an effective method of horizontally scaling WebSockets. There are several off-the-shelf solutions like Kafka or Redis that can make this happen.\nAre there problems with WebSocket’s load balancing?\nDespite its obvious benefits, there remain some concerns with utilizing WebSockets for load balancing.\nFor example, if a WebSocket-based app is running on two servers and the load balancer is distributing connections evenly across them, it won't distribute any of the existing traffic when a third server is added.\nThis is because by their very nature, WebSocket connections are persistent so they remain on whatever node that they were first connected to.\nThis then requires the first two servers to be restarted in the hopes that incoming clients would reconnect and the load will then be distributed across the three servers evenly.\nIf both the initial servers do restart at the exact same time, the load balancer will have already directed all connections to the third server, meaning that the initial two now have no connections.\nThe persistent behavior of WebSockets can often take people by surprise even when they're carrying out simple tasks like a rolling upgrade of nodes. Traffic inadvertently ends up being sent to just one node, leading to scalability issues.\nHow to create a persistent connection with WebSocket\nThere’s a clear benefit that establishing a persistent connection between the client and the server provides. This can be done in a variety of ways but WebSockets are considered to be the best way to create a persistent connection between a client like a web browser and the server.\nA persistent connection allows for two-way data exchange between the client and the server. This results in lower latency and a better use of the available resources.\nThe WebSockets protocol, defined in specification RFC 6455, allows for a full-duplex communication channel between the client and the server. This channel is initiated from an HTTP(s) request that has an \"upgrade\" header.\nThe data is sent in both directions as packets without additional HTTP-requests. This persistent connection is very useful for services like real-time trading systems or online games that require continuous data exchange.\nA new WebSocket needs to be created in order to open a WebSocket connection that allows for bidirectional communication. Once the socket has been created, events need to be listened on it.\nThe events include open, message, error, and close. When a new WebSocket URL is created, it starts connecting immediately. WebSockets can also have additional headers that define extensions and subprotocols.\nHow WebSocket development can help your business’ custom applications\nIt's advantageous to use WebSocket for business applications over HTTP. The persistent connection that it establishes between the client and server allows for data to be sent from the server to the client at any time, even if it has not been requested by the client.\nThis is what's commonly known as server-push and it comes in handy when the client needs to be told about something that has happened on the server.\nFor business use-cases, this might be an alert to customers about a price drop or new messages in their inbox. WebSockets makes this possible unlike HTTP which doesn't support pushing data to clients. With HTTP, the client would have to regularly poll by making an HTTP request every few seconds to get the new data.\nIt also helps reduce latency significantly. Latency means the time delay between the data being requested and the response being provided by the server.\nWebSockets can reduce latency as it allows for data to be sent much faster as the connection is already established. There's no need for any additional packet round trips to establish the TCP connection.\nWebSockets should be considered for modern app development as it has a lot of benefits that can help businesses get the most out of their apps.

How do you provide gated access to data from the organization to a third-party or enable them to use certain services without revealing the underlying software platform?\nAn API or application programming interface is what makes it happen. APIs are the interface that define the interaction between different software intermediaries.

    "extractedText": "CUSTOM SOFTWARE\nFlex Programming\nIan J.H Reynolds\nExplore Ian J.H Reynolds' expertise in finance and economics through his insightful articles on market trends, investment strategies, and economic analysis.\nMore posts by Ian J.H Reynolds.\nIAN J.H REYNOLDS\n18 NOV 2020 • 6 MIN READ\nThere's no shortage of frameworks that allow you to build and maintain web applications for a wide variety of platforms.\nMany have fallen out of favor in recent years as developers move towards more modern and flexible frameworks, but there are some that continue to be used, even though many would question their usefulness in this day and age.\nFlex happens to be one of them. Flex was developed by Adobe as an open source application framework that allowed developers to build and maintain web apps that could be consistently deployed across all major browsers, computers, and mobile devices.\nThe aim with Flex was to provide a modern, standards-based language and programming model that allowed for common design patterns that were suitable for developers from many backgrounds.\nWith Flex, it's possible to build mobile apps for iOS, Android, and even BlackBerry OS devices in addition to conventional apps for desktops and browsers using the same model, tool, and codebase.\nWhat is Flex in programming?\nFlex is Adobe's open-source application framework. It's powerful and flexible, in that it enables developers to build mobile apps for different platforms and conventional apps for desktops and browsers with the same code base, tools, and model.\nFlex apps can only be built through the free Flex SDK while the Adobe Flash Builder software speeds up development by offering features like intelligent code editing, memory and performance filters, step-through debugging, and visual design.\nEnterprise-grade advanced data services are also offered by Adobe through its open source BladeDS project as well as the commercial Adobe LiveCycle Data Services ES2 module.\nFlex can be used to create a range of highly interactive and expressive apps for mobile, web, and desktop. A data visualization app built in Flex, for example, can bring in data from different back-end sources and visually display it.\nThis will be a useful solution for business users who can then dive deeper into the data, change it and even have it automatically updated on the back end.\nAnother example of an app built with Flex can be that of a product configuration app that enables customers to easily select or customize products online. A self-service app can make it easier for users to change an address or complete steps that would otherwise be complicated.\nDo people still use Flex?\nFlex is one of the programming frameworks that has fallen out of favor. Adobe announced in November 2011 that they will no longer support Adobe Flex. They didn't kill the framework, though, instead they donated it to Apache.\nThe Apache Flex team has since been working on fixing bugs and providing additional components but the number of developers that actually use Flex now is very small. So even though it’s still around, there really doesn’t seem to be a prosperous future in the cards for Flex.\nPrograms and companies that run on Flex\nBusinessQ is one of the many apps that have been built using Flex. It enables businesses to transform their raw data into actionable information. Businesses can have rows and rows of data in ERP and CRM systems.\nThey can learn so much from it by scientifically examining the data.\nThe BusinessQ intelligence and data visualization software from Qualia lets them do just that.\nFrom monitoring sales to overseeing inventory and tracking Key Performance Indicators, the BusinessQ software lets businesses spot otherwise hidden patterns so that any potential problems can be spotted in time to mitigate risk.\ndotSlope is a very useful app for civil, geotechnical, and mining engineers that's also created with Flex.\nIt's a professional grade web and mobile app that has been developed to allow engineers to analyze slope stability problems through the limit equilibrium theory.\nRecovery Act Dashboard has also highlighted Flex’s usability for the government sector. The Department of Energy decided to develop a solution to track the billions of dollars invested over a diverse set of energy projects. So the Recovery Act Dashboard was created using Flex.\nHow to develop a custom app for your business using Flex\nTools like Flex Builder are required to develop Flex applications. The very first step involves utilizing the Flash Builder IDE wizard to create the new project. The application type can then be selected, for example, Web can be selected if a web app needs to be developed.\nDevelopers then need to create an external CSS file and then modify the wrapper HTML page template. An internal CSS file is also required in addition to several other steps that need to be completed first before the app can be built and run.\n3 alternatives to Flex: What could you use instead?\nPhoneGap:\nPhoneGap is a very powerful alternative to Flex. It's widely used for cross-platform app development. PhoneGap is an open source mobile app development framework by Adobe, it allows developers to create mobile applications with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.\nPhoneGap was first called Apache Cordova. It was initially introduced by Nitobi Software which was later acquired by Adobe. That's when Adobe renamed Apache Cordova to PhoneGap.\nOne of the reasons why so many developers prefer PhoneGap is because of its cross-platform compatibility. Developing apps for different platforms can be cumbersome so a framework that helps make that process easier is certainly going to be highly regarded.\nPhoneGap has proven to be a great cross-platform development framework. It's compatible with many major platforms like iOS, Android, webOS, Tizen, Bada, Symbian, and BlackBerry. The developers thus only have to write the code once and the app can be made compatible with all of these different platforms.\nPhoneGap is also preferred because it allows developers with limited resources to make their apps available on multiple platforms without the need for additional resources.\nA single program for an app can be written and then run on all of the desired platforms. App developers also get better access to the native APIs so that the apps can effectively use the device's camera, accelerometer, geolocation, contacts, and other core features.\nReact Native\nFacebook has created its own open source mobile app framework called React Native. It enables developers to make apps for platforms like iOS, macOS, tvOS, Android, Android TV, web, Windows, and UWP.\nDevelopers can do this by utilizing React's framework with the platform's native capabilities.\nReact Native is a JavaScript-based framework that's already being used by some of the world's biggest companies, including but not limited to Microsoft, Uber, and Facebook itself.\nLike other open source tools, developers are only required to create code once and they can then use React Native to power their apps on all eligible platforms, thereby saving a lot of time and resources for them.\nReact Native essentially got its start when Facebook developer Jordan Walke made a revolutionizing discovery in 2013. He had discovered a method of generating UI elements for iOS apps through JavaScript.\nThis sparked a huge interest to ascertain just how much mobile app development could be performed using the conventionally web-based JavaScript solutions. Facebook initially offered React Native for iOS but it was later updated with Android support. The framework then went public in 2015.\nBootstrap\nBootstrap is another useful Flex alternative that's highly regarded for web development. It's a free and open-source CSS framework that allows developers to create responsive, mobile-first web pages.\nBootstrap has CSS and JavaScript-based design templates for UI elements and other interface components.\nIt was developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter initially as a framework to improve consistently for internal tools. Before Bootstrap, different libraries had to be used for interface development. That led to a high maintenance burden.\nThe main focus of the Bootstrap framework is to simplify the development of informative web pages.\nThe primary benefit that it provides is in the form of its choices of layout, color, size, and font to the project. When it has been added to a project, Bootstrap provides a basic style definition for all HTML elements.\nThis results in a uniform appearn for tables, prose, and form elements across all web browsers. Developers can also utilize CSS classes defined in Bootstrap if they want more customization for the appearance of their content.\nWork with a development partner who can help with it all\nWhether you still prefer to use Flex for a business app or are more interested in utilizing one of the many powerful alternatives that are now available, you need to work with a software development partner that is well versed in the intricacies of all of these platforms.\nZibtek is trusted by both Fortune 500 companies and startups alike.

The answer is literally in the name itself.\nA CMS enables users to create, manage and modify content for their website. It provides a one-stop solution even for those who may not have any technical web development knowledge.\nSetting up a website can prove to be a daunting task, particularly if you don't have the development skills required for everything to function. With a CMS, it's possible to get a website or blog up and running within a short time.\nThat's not all what a CMS is good for, though. If you have the development skills, a lot of value can be extracted from a content management system.\nThere are a lot of moving parts that go into building a functional website. You need a system that can store images, create web pages, and provide other functions like the ability for visitors to leave comments or for you to keep an eye on the metrics. All of the core infrastructure stuff is handled by the CMS.\nWhat is Sitecore?\nSitecore is one of the widely used content management systems for a very particular reason. It goes beyond just allowing users to create and collaborate on the production and editing of web content.\nThis system makes it possible for users to manage the overall digital experience for their visitors across the many different channels that they use including mobile apps, social media, email, and more.\nThat's the main reason why Sitecore is the preferred CMS for marketers. It offers a feature-packed, customer-centric platform that allows users to create elaborate marketing campaigns, optimize content across different digital channels, track analytics data from all platforms, and more.\nFeatures\nSitecore offers a variety of features like the Sitecore Experience Platform which brings together customer data, analytics, and marketing automation capabilities in one place, enabling businesses to deliver personalized content to their customers in real-time across any channel.\nThis feature is particularly powerful because of its headless architecture which makes it possible to create content just once and display it on any digital presence that the business has.\nIt goes further with Sitecore AI that relies on auto-personalization to identify visitor trends and create customer segments automatically so that the page elements can be modified to deliver a truly unique user experience to every individual customer.\nSitecore's ecommerce features improve customer engagement, personalize online stores with real-time context and historical insights, provide integrated marketing and promotion automation to improve conversions, and enable businesses to run their entire ecommerce operations from one place.\nContent Hub gives Sitecore users a holistic view of their content landscape. They can access all of their digital content from one dashboard and use the personalization features to deliver unique user experiences. It also streamlines planning and scheduling of content production while seamlessly integrating with Sitecore's CMS and commerce solutions.\nPrice\nExactly how much it would cost to use Sitecore depends on two categories: License costs and partner costs. The license costs are subscription-based and they vary depending on the number of visits to the site per month, non-production installations, add-on modules, and concurrent users.\nSitecore's packages are further split into Standard, Corporate, and Enterprise tiers for websites that receive up to 2, 12, and 240 million visitors per year respectively.\nThe number of test and development environments needed for the business will also have a bearing on how much Sitecore will cost. The same holds true for the number of users that are concurrently using the platform.\nThe company also offers a variety of add-on modules that can further increase the price. These include add-ons like the Sitecore Experience Commerce and Content Hub.\nThe modules are in addition to the core Experience Manager and Experience Platform solutions that include the WYSIWYG editor, search options, forms, Active Directory, Sitecore JavaScript services, Sitecore AI, and more.\nYou would also incur partner costs if you're paying a Sitecore partner for the development and maintenance of your online presence. This cost will vary depending on the level of custom development work required, integration with other systems, any ongoing support needs, hosting, etc.\nWhat makes Sitecore the best CMS?\nIts powerful suite of features is what makes Sitecore the best CMS on the market. It offers a one-stop solution to marketers, enabling them to manage and update all of their digital channels from one single dashboard.\nIt eliminates the need to juggle multiple solutions and to have resources manually dedicated to operating and updating those platforms.\nSitecore makes it possible for them to collect data from any and all customer touchpoints that can then be analyzed using the provided tools to make informed decisions for enhancing the customer experience.\nWith the AI-based personalization functionality, every customer can be provided a completely unique experience which significantly increases conversion rates.\nCompanies that use Sitecore\nSome of the world’s biggest companies rely on Sitecore to manage their online presence. They have given the platform a vote of confidence since they have selected Sitecore to manage their vast digital presence across the globe.\nThese companies aren’t going to invest their time and money in tools that don’t provide them with the results that they require.\nL’Oréal is one such company. It's pursuing its goal of becoming the top digital beauty brand in the world. The company is relying on Sitecore to deliver a consistent brand experience to customers through its over 3,000 different websites.\nSitecore also makes it possible for L’Oréal to create a personalized shopping experience for customers and enable its 60 country subsidiaries to effectively localize products and scale for more growth.\nThe Formula-E motorsport series has leveraged Sitecore to create a global web and app experience in order to increase fan engagement. It's relying on the platform to build a community of fans for the electric-powered motorsport series.\nIt's highly important for Formula-E to continuously engage fans during the 13 races in 12 cities spread across 5 continents with accessible and user-friendly content.\nProcter & Gamble, one of the world's biggest consumer goods companies, uses Sitecore to transform its massive global digital marketing presence. Sitecore provides it with an agile platform that reduces costs, speeds up time to market, and delivers a superior customer experience.\nP&G has to manage hundreds of brand variations and online properties in excess of 800. It has a significant number of digital marketing professionals and creative agencies working with it to provide a consistent brand experience across 80 countries in dozens of languages.\nThe company has since consolidated 10 content management systems into Sitecore XP, thereby reducing its costs by 33%.\nWhat Sitecore can do for your business\nEvery business has its own unique set of needs so what works for P&G, for example, is not necessarily going to work for a small chain of department stores. That’s beside the point, though.\nWhat matters more are the tools that some of the world’s leading companies are using and how those tools can be leveraged by businesses of all nature to grow further.\nSitecore can help you effectively supercharge your online presence while reducing complexity. It eliminates the need to manage dozens of different systems and also to employ a lot more people to run those systems.\nThat’s an ineffective way of doing business in an age when it pays to be lightning fast with your online strategies.\nLeveraging the Sitecore platform can help you increase sales, improve customer experience, cut costs for greater profit margins as well as easily maintain a digital presence across any and all platforms that you use.\nFinding a solid Sitecore developer to build out your business\nThere’s much value to be extracted from the Sitecore platform and businesses that are looking to get the most out of it should work with a trusted Sitecore developer.\nThey will be able to develop custom solutions and ensure that Sitecore is integrated with existing systems properly so that no time and money is wasted in getting things up to speed.\nZibtek has long been a trusted partner for companies looking to make the shift to Sitecore.\nOur expert advisors can work with you to determine exactly what you need out of the Sitecore platform and also walk you through what it would cost for you to use Sitecore based on the unique needs of your business.\nWe’re one of the fastest growing software development companies in the world, having worked with both Fortune 500 companies and startups over the past few decades.\nOur team of developers operates from our offices in Salt Lake City, Utah and that’s also where we manage our global talent pool of experts. If you’re curious about what Sitecore can do for your business, just want to find out how much it may cost to use it, or require some custom development work for an existing Sitecore implementation, reach out to Zibtek today.

    "extractedText": "CUSTOM SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT\nIs Extreme Programming Methodology Worth It?\nIan J.H Reynolds\nExplore Ian J.H Reynolds' expertise in finance and economics through his insightful articles on market trends, investment strategies, and economic analysis.\nMore posts by Ian J.H Reynolds.\nIAN J.H REYNOLDS\n4 NOV 2020 • 6 MIN READ\nSoftware development is a complete science in and of itself. While it may seem overly complex to someone who doesn’t possess the skills, it also flows like poetry from skilled developers who have the capability to create powerful and highly useful products and services through code.\nSome people often have the misconception that developers can just jump into the project at a moment’s notice and create such products.\nThat couldn’t be further from the truth. Effective software development can only be achieved through the implementation of a carefully crafted process.\nThe developer needs to have clarity on the needs of the project, the tech stack that's to be used, the development framework, in addition to many different factors. Only then does it become possible for them to create products and services that have the potential to change lives.\nWhat is Extreme Programming (XP) Methodology?\nTo understand what is Extreme Programming methodology, we first need to form an understanding of agile software development.\nThis is an approach to software development that prioritizes incremental delivery, collaboration between the team, continual planning in order to keep the process lean.\nThe idea with agile development is to create minimum viable products that go through several iterations before being finalized instead of trying to deliver everything at once at the very end of the project.\nExtreme Programming is a framework of agile development. It is concerned with the production of higher quality software as well as a higher quality of life for the development team.\nIt's the most specific of agile frameworks that's concerned with precise engineering practices for development.\nAn important aspect of XP methodology is to improve software responsiveness in response to changing customer requirements.\nIt prioritizes frequent releases in short development cycles to improve productivity and add checkpoints where new customer requirements can be introduced.\nHow to use XP Methodology in your software development\nThe Extreme Programming methodology isn't going to work for all development teams but it has the potential of delivering incredible value for teams that are the perfect fit for it.\nExtreme Programming can work very well for projects that require a change in functionality every few months or have constantly changing requirements.\nIt's a particularly effective approach when dealing with customers who aren't quite sure what they want their custom software system to do. XP is also a great way to mitigate project risk when dealing with very tight deadlines.\nIt can be worth giving Extreme Programming a shot in your software development if continuous development and collaboration is a serious business need.\nSince this development model is highly adaptable, it requires ongoing feedback and incentivizes developers to work together to ensure a healthy product release, thereby also increasing productivity for the teams.\nFour practices of Extreme Programming\nIn order to achieve the intended objectives with XP, these four practices should be followed: Coding, Testing, Listening and Designing. They're split as such because if you don't code, you haven't done anything.\nYou test because if you don't test, you don't know when you're done coding. It's important to listen because if you don't, you can't find out what to code or what to test.\nDesign is important because that way, you can keep coding, testing, and listening indefinitely.\nAdvantages\nSave time and resources\nAny project that can be delivered before deadline and under budget is far more preferable than projects that incur cost overruns and miss deadlines.\nXP provides development teams with a great opportunity to reduce project costs and push out deliverables in a timely manner.\nAdd simplicity to the project\nProjects don't necessarily need to be complex. Developers that utilize the XP methodology create simple code that can be improved at any moment.\nThis, in turn, helps speed up the development process. It also makes it easier for new resources to hit the ground running as there’s not a significant learning curve.\nFlexibility to make changes\nSince the XP methodology revolves around flexibility, it makes it possible to quickly add new functionality or remove functionality from the product.\nDevelopers can listen to the feedback provided and make any changes that may be required by the customer.\nDisadvantages\nNot highly focused on design\nSome developers are of the view that the Extreme Programming methodology focuses too much on the code and not enough on the design.\nAs developers will tell you, great design is essential to create a great software product. A great design can also be one of the USPs of the product.\nCode quality assurance not measured\nDevelopers also consider not measuring code quality assurance as one of the disadvantages of the XP methodology. It's not something that happens for the vast majority of projects that are undertaken with XP, but in some cases it may cause defects in the initial code.\nNot suitable for remote teams\nExtreme Programming is better suited to development teams that work and collaborate together. That’s one of the core reasons why it supports such agile development.\nHaving your development team spread across different regions would minimize the beneficial impact of using XP for software development.\nIs a developer that uses Extreme Programming Methodology worth it?\nWhether or not a developer who uses Extreme Programming methodology is worth it depends upon what your requirements are for the project being done. As explained above, there are specific instances in which XP can prove to be highly useful.\nJust because it facilitates greater collaboration and more agile development doesn’t mean that it’s going to be the perfect fit for all software development work.\nCompanies that view continuous development as a business need should consider the XP methodology as it has the potential to deliver incredible value for their projects.\nThe benefits only compound once there’s clarity that the project being done is indeed a good fit for XP. The speed at which the development work will proceed will ensure that there are no costly delays and that the product releases can take place as per schedule.\nThere’s also the cost reduction factor, it can enable businesses to reduce the amount of resources that they spend on a project. Similarly, it also adds a layer of simplicity to the project. This only goes to improve the overall quality of the work being done.\nSo before working with a developer that uses the Extreme Programming methodology, it would be best to discuss the project in great detail with them.\nThis will enable them to understand what the needs for the project are and whether XP is even going to be a good fit for it or not.\nThey will also be able to make recommendations in this regard. If XP isn’t found to be a good fit for your project, the developer that you work with will be able to guide you towards an alternative agile development framework that would be better suited to the kind of work that you’re looking for.\nOur methodology at Zibtek\nAt Zibtek, we know a thing or two about Extreme Programming.

    "extractedText": "WEB DEVELOPMENT\nHTML5 vs. Flash\nIan J.H Reynolds\nExplore Ian J.H Reynolds' expertise in finance and economics through his insightful articles on market trends, investment strategies, and economic analysis.\nMore posts by Ian J.H Reynolds.\nIAN J.H REYNOLDS\n2 NOV 2020 • 6 MIN READ\nThere’s a greater need now than ever before for rich web applications. Users really don't like having to jump around so if they land on a webpage, they would expect an embedded video to play on that page itself instead of redirecting them somewhere else. Multimedia software platforms enable developers to provide those seamless experiences.\nOne can’t talk about multimedia software platforms without mentioning Adobe Flash. Even though it has fallen out of favor now, Flash has had a transformative impact on the industry. It enabled developers to display vector graphics, text, animations, video games, and stream embedded videos on web pages.\nThe future isn’t Flash, though; it’s being forged by HTML5.\nHTML5\nAs the name suggests, HTML5 is the fifth major version of the HTML markup language. It's used for structuring and presenting content on the web. HTML5 added support for the latest multimedia and other modern features like the ability to play audio and video within web pages as well as using scalable vector graphics.\nWhat is it used for?\nHTML5 is used for modification and adjustment of the appearance of web pages. It's also used for providing structure and presenting content on the web. It allows browsers like Chrome, Safari, and Firefox to know how a web page needs to be displayed and where each element is supposed to go.\nIt's also widely used to add multimedia content to web pages without having to use a separate media player or even Flash. HTML5 has also made it possible to create lightweight web apps that can provide a lot of functionality while being responsive and adapting to different devices like desktops, smartphones, and tablets.\nAdvantages\nCleaner code\nThere’s nothing that developers love more than the opportunity to have cleaner code. With the kind of simplicity that it provides, HTML5 takes this to another level. Web developers that use HTML5 work with much cleaner code. For example, they can remove and replace the div tags with semantic HTML5 elements.\nSupport for rich media elements\nThe inherent support that HTML5 has for rich media elements further adds to how easy it makes life for developers. With integrated capability to play audio and video content, developers no longer have to keep up with separate plugin tags.\nOffline app cache\nThis particular feature of HTML5 goes a long way in reducing load on the server. The offline app cache feature loads the page that the user has visited even if they're offline for the time being. The result is that files load much faster and it's possible to provide a better user experience.\nDisadvantages\nVideo standard support is a mess\nHTML5 is great for embedding video players in web pages however, there's no single standard for video support that would add simplicity to the process.\nThere are different video standards that are all supported by HTML5 with three most widely used standards being Ogg Theory, H.265, and WebM. Different browsers may run into issues displaying the content if they have support for one or the other.\nLegacy browsers are not supported\nUsers with older machines that use legacy browsers will have problems accessing HTML5-based websites and apps. Internet Explorer is a glaring example of an outdated browser that's still in use but lacks the compatibility for HTML5.\nDoesn't allow for a robust gaming experience\nSince JavaScript is the only scripting language of HTML5, it lacks the features required to enable a robust gaming experience. Developers will be aware that member access, interfaces, custom name spaces, and more all struggle with JavaScript. There are workarounds but they aren't conducive to making HTML5 a first choice language for games.\nPerformance\nHTML5 itself enables developers to create high-performance solutions but there's a lot else that needs to be done in order to maximize performance. For example, hardware acceleration is the preferred method for improving overall render performance. This is done by offloading tasks that would be performed by the CPU to the dedicated graphics processing unit.\nDevelopers can also use JavaScript profilers to get a holistic view of their app's performance on the function level. This is done by measuring the time taken to execute each individual function from beginning to the end.\nRelevant changes can then be made to further improve the performance.\nFlash\nFlash was developed as a response to the growing need for a solution that allowed developers to enable audio and video playback on the web. It quickly became the de facto standard that was used in place of individual and often clunky audio and video plugins.\nWhat’s it used for?\nFlash is used for embedded video players in web browsers and for the production of desktop and mobile apps as well as for animations. It can also capture camera, microphone, and keyboard input.\nIt has since fallen out of favor as HTML5 has grown to be more popular and doesn't quite suffer from the same security vulnerabilities as Flash. Some of the biggest backers of Flash, like YouTube, have now ditched it. Even YouTube now relies on the media rendering capabilities of HTML5. Adobe now favors a transition to HTML5 itself.\nAdvantages\nExtensive developer community\nSince Flash has been around for such a long time, there's a massive community of developers that can be tapped into for help and support.\nIt's also possible to easily acquire free or low-cost pre-built files that have been created by developers for other developers, allowing them to get their projects off the ground quickly.\nBetter integration with legacy browsers\nFor the simple reason that it has been around for long enough, Flash also has better integration with legacy browsers and older devices. It doesn’t run into the same limitations that HTML5 has when it comes to outdated browsers.\nSupports enhanced interactivity\nSome of the earliest interactive experiences on the web were built using Flash. Since it can capture mouse, keyboard, microphone, and camera input, developers can thus create solutions that enable visitors to have enhanced interactions with content.\nDisadvantages\nInteractivity can be distracting\nSome developers can tend to go overboard with all of the interactive elements that they can add to their sites with Flash. This takes away from the actual content itself and may also prevent them from creating a better UX. Users may end up with a poor experience as a result.\nIssues with indexing content coding\nIt's possible to run into issues with indexing of the content coding. Search engine positioning suffers neglect within the Flash animation.\nTo work around this, developers would use JavaScript to add the Flash movie and then find a backup HTML for SEO. It just added a layer of complexity to the project.\nFlash is on its way out\nFlash isn’t really an option for new projects because the standard itself is now on its way out in favor of HTML5.\nAdobe already announced in 2017 that Flash will be declared end-of-life after 2020. It will no longer support, distribute or provide security updates for Flash Player. Flash will not be updated or maintained after December 2020.\nPerformance\nAchieving greater performance with Flash was possible since it used vector graphics combined with program code. The result was that the Flash files would be smaller and streams would use less bandwidth compared to video clips or bitmaps. The Flash Player also had a virtual machine called the ActionScript VM which scripted interactivity at run-time for performance.\nWhich should you use?\nWith Flash on its way out, it only makes sense to use HTML5 going forward. The industry has thrown its weight behind HTML5 so any solutions created using the latest iteration of this markup language will be completely future-proof. There’s nothing that threatens the future of HTML5 so it will not suffer the same fate as Flash.\nAs if that wasn’t a reason enough, HTML5’s benefits far outweigh those of Flash. It allows for solutions to be more responsive, adaptive, and powerful.\nThe offline app cache is just one example of a highly useful feature that it provides. HTML5 is also easier for developers to work with, allowing them to create more complex software solutions swiftly.\nThese benefits can only be enjoyed if you work with developers who know what they’re doing.\nAt Zibtek, our expert software engineers are highly proficient in HTML5 development. We are based in the United States with offices in Salt Lake City, Utah. Zibtek also manages a global talent pool of skilled developers who can be assigned to your projects.\nOur developers know HTML5 like the back of their hand, building apps that can be used on any device that has a web browser.\nThis allows them to function as cross-platform apps, allowing you to put your business and brand across more customers without having to make significant investments in dedicated cross-platform app development.If you’re considering HTML5 for a project or are just curious about how the technology might be of use to your business, reach out to Zibtek today and our team will be happy to sit down with you and figure out a solution that works best.

These programs would enable people to perform a variety of tasks, such as image editing, bookkeeping, word processing, and more. Businesses used special programs that allowed them to manage the various parts of their organization.\nA lot has changed over the past two decades. Computing as we knew it has gone through a fundamental shift. Cloud-based services have emerged as the technology of choice for both individuals and businesses. Powerful applications are now within reach and accessing them requires not much more than a browser and an internet connection.\nWhat is a SaaS Developer?\nSaaS or Software-as-a-Service is a popular model of cloud computing and a SaaS developer is the person behind the code developing it. In this software distribution model, a third-party service provider hosts the application and makes it available to the end users over the internet.\nIn this model, software is centrally hosted and licensed to users on a subscription basis. SaaS applications are primarily accessed by users through a thin client like web browsers.\nSaaS is the evolution of the application service provider (ASP) model that emerged in the 1990s. ASPs offered businesses the service of managing and hosting their customized business applications with a view to reduce their costs and provide them the benefits of the ASPs expertise in a particular business application.\nThe fundamental difference between the ASP and SaaS model now is that ASPs initially managed and hosted third-party vendors' software. They weren't making their own software.\nThe majority of SaaS vendors develop and manage their own software which is then licensed out to customers through their own infrastructure. ASPs also dealt with conventional client-server applications while SaaS applications generally require only a browser for access.\nExamples of popular SaaS models\nSaaS providers develop products that offer some value to customers. They hope to be able to charge a fee against the value provided.\nThe biggest challenge that SaaS providers face is finding the pricing sweet spot that enables them to turn over a profit while also convincing their customers that the fee they’re paying is worth the value they’re receiving in return. To that end, there are several pricing models that service providers can consider when starting out.\nFlat Rate Pricing\nThis is one of the most commonly used SaaS models. Customers get one single product that offers a set of features for one set price. This is quite similar to the software licensing models of the past where customers would pay a one-time fee for an application.\nPer User Pricing\nMany service providers opt for this model for applications that they have primarily created for businesses. Customers have to pay per user. For example, a marketing agency with 100 employees will pay significantly more for an analysis tool to get access for all employees than one that only pays for access for 10 employees.\nPay As You Go Pricing\nThis model is most commonly used by infrastructure and platform-related companies like Azure and AWS. Customers are only charged for the amount of resources, like bandwidth and API requests, that they consume. This provides them with the flexibility to scale their operations up or down without incurring hardware costs.\nWhat does a SaaS developer do?\nA SaaS developer has the important task of bringing the vision behind the product to life. They should have a clear understanding of the monetization model, the needs of the target audience, and the technology stack that needs to be used in order to build the product.\nThe developer handles the number of features that are to be built into the product and also manages the service upgrade frequency.\nThey're also responsible for integrating the product with other services through APIs. They're responsible for ensuring the scalability, security, and reliability of the platform.\nHow does SaaS compare to IaaS and PaaS?\nSaaS, IaaS, and PaaS are regarded as the three main components of cloud computing. They happen to have several differences between them, even though they're all essentially different methods of using cloud computing technology for your business.\nIaaS\nIaaS or Infrastructure as a Service is a cloud computing model that provides customers with storage, networking, and virtualization resources on a pay-as-you-go pricing model.\nThe idea is to provide customers with the flexibility of utilizing as many or as little resources as possible on their products. This eliminates the need for them to make costly investments in on-premises hardware.\nA startup may not have enough capital to set up their own data center. It's a very costly endeavor but one they can avoid by relying entirely on IaaS providers like AWS EC2.\nIt provides flexible and scalable infrastructure for customers that want to host applications in the cloud. They're only required to pay for the server resources that they use, not for the entire hardware stack.\nPaaS\nPlatform as a Service or PaaS is primarily meant for developers. Vendors that provide these services offer hardware and software tools to developers over the internet so that they may use them to develop applications.\nThese tools are built on virtualization technology to help save time for developers so that they don't have to start from scratch when writing code.\nPaaS vendors now provide a very cost effective method for developers to create their own unique application even if they don't have a significant amount of system administration knowledge. Vendors like Magento offer the Commerce Cloud as a PaaS for ecommerce. Merchants can develop their host as part of the package with Magneto.\nWhat skills does a SaaS developer need?\nThere are several skills that are required to build a web-based SaaS product. The developer needs to have knowledge of server-side development with the likes of Python in addition to client-side development using HTML and CSS with a Javascript frame work like angular or react for interaction. Knowledge in database design and management will also be useful.\nSaaS developers should ideally pick the server-side language that they're most comfortable in, though most opt for Python with Django as its go-to-web framework.\nPure Javascript can be useful for client-side development with jQuery being the preferred Javascript framework / library. Other frameworks like AngularJs can be useful, too.\nAdditional skills that include user interface and experience design can prove to be helpful. Good visual design skills will only add more polish to the final product. If the developer also needs to perform server management then they need to have those skills as well.\nWhat to look for in a SaaS developer for your business software\nYou might have an amazing idea for a SaaS product but it’s not possible to turn that idea into reality unless you work with a highly skilled developer.\nThere are several things that you should look for in a potential candidate, as they are the ones who will be bringing your vision to life and you’d want the work to be up to your expectations.\nThey need to have the requisite skills otherwise, the work on your product might not be up to the mark. That would force you to revisit parts of the project that should have already been completed, and result in delays and additional cost to just get the product up and running.\nThe developer that you choose to work with should have a deep understanding of your vision for the product. It’s vital that both parties are on the same page with regards to how the project is to move forward.\nSaaS software development can be costly, especially if you don't have your own in-house development team. It would cost significantly more to establish a dedicated team of software developers, and it would be a time consuming process as finding high quality talent is difficult and often very competitive.\nThat's why most people prefer outsourcing the job to third-party service providers that can get the job done quickly. They already have talented developers on the payroll and the team can quickly be deployed to work on your project. This ensures that no time is wasted and that the work begins as soon as you give the project the green light.\nFinding reliable third-party service providers can be a challenge but it’s far from impossible. Zibtek has been a partner to many of the industry’s leading companies, developing powerful SaaS products for them quickly.\nAt Zibtek, we have a whole team of experienced developers that can cater to any custom software requests.

    "extractedText": "What You Need to Know About Enterprise Mobile Apps\nIan J.H Reynolds\nExplore Ian J.H Reynolds' expertise in finance and economics through his insightful articles on market trends, investment strategies, and economic analysis.\nMore posts by Ian J.H Reynolds.\nIAN J.H REYNOLDS\n10 OCT 2020 • 6 MIN READ\nMobile apps have been around for more than a decade now. It’s hard to imagine a time when we didn’t have dozens of little icons on our phones that gave us access to powerful tools, useful services, and even some amazing games. That’s not all that mobile apps are good for, though.\nAs businesses have deployed new smart devices across their organizations, the need for enterprise mobile apps has increased significantly. Mobile devices are widely used in almost every industry.\nWhether that’s tablets on the production floor of a clothing manufacturer or rugged smartphones in the hands of oil rig workers. These devices have forever changed the way businesses operate and how their employees work. There’s a great need now than ever before for applications that are specifically designed to cater to the individual needs of a business.\nUnderstanding enterprise mobile app development\nThere is a big difference in an enterprise mobile app compared to something that lets you check the weather in another country. The latter is meant for anyone and everyone. Consumer apps cast a wide net by default. Their developers want them to be used by as many people as possible.\nThat’s not the case with enterprise apps. They’re not made available to the public as they’re only meant to be used by the employees of a particular organization. The app’s functionality is highly specific to that business as well. All of the features that it offers are meant to make it easier for employees to work smarter and improve productivity.\nEnterprise mobile apps bring a wide range of possibilities within your reach. They can be used to improve the customer experience, speed up warehouse processes, make internal workflows simpler, improve communication within departments, provide easy access to a company-wide knowledge base, and more.\nThe true benefit of these apps can only be gained once they are developed based on the exact requirements that a business has. Everything needs to be built from the ground up with those unique business needs in mind.\nEnterprise mobile app development is all about offering a powerful solution to business who can’t get the same feature set from a comparable, standard app.\nHow do mobile apps help your business?\nThere’s a lot that mobile apps can do for your business. They can enable employees to be more productive as they will have the tools in hand to take quick decisions.\nWhether that’s releasing something from the inventory, assigning tasks to managers on the production floor, and even tweaking settings on industrial machinery. All this and more can be achieved with mobile apps.\nIn addition to streamlining things behind the scenes, mobile apps also provide your business with a direct touchpoint to your customers. By offering them an app, you establish a direct line of communication.\nFeatures like push notifications and alerts can then be used to inform existing customers about new promotions or products. Return customers are more likely to make a purchase than new customers, so even a simple mobile app can lead to higher revenues for your business.\nCreating custom enterprise mobile apps vs. using existing platforms\nThere’s value to be gained from existing platforms. There’s no shortage of such tools for business owners and they have become quite robust and useful in the past few years. There are existing platforms for everything from customer service management, order fulfillment, inventory management, employee engagement, and more.\nWhat really matters is the organization’s own preferences. Exactly what are they looking to get out of the mobile apps that they want to deploy across the entire organization. Remember, this is something that’s going to be used country-wide, so there needs to be a firm understanding of the features required to meet business needs.\nCompanies that are just starting out or those who don’t have a relatively complicated business model may find value in opting for existing platforms. However, companies that require powerful solutions that are made to service their exact business needs will always prefer custom enterprise mobile app development.\nThat’s because there’s really no substitute for this. You can either go with an off-the-shelf solution that tries a one-size-fits-all approach for all users, or you can have something made from scratch that’s meant for addressing the unique needs of your business.\nFive trends to look out for in enterprise mobile apps\nPersonalization\nMobile apps and devices have really made it easier for users to set things up just right, so that they don’t have to change the way they work in order to get the most out of the app, it should let them make changes so that they can work in the way they want to work.\nIt’s important for this trend to be followed in enterprise mobile apps as well, since these apps are all about work anyway. Due importance needs to be given to the fact that the app should help improve the employee’s efficiency and providing them with personalization options is a great way of achieving that.\nArtificial Intelligence\nArtificial intelligence is much more than the buzzword that you hear being thrown around often. The technology has come a long way in recent years and has proven to be a useful addition to mobile apps. Many people have the misconception that AI is a flashy hologram assistant that obeys the user’s commands.\nIt’s something else entirely. Predictive typing features that offer suggestions based on your typing patterns is also AI, so is the smart feature on your smartphone that knows not to close frequently used apps in the background. Enterprise mobile apps can utilize AI to automate many repetitive tasks and also to increase efficiency.\nCloud Support\nMost of our user data lives in the cloud now. These storage services are actively promoted as a cheap and fast way to store a lot of data without having to carry any external hard drives or flash drives with you. Businesses stand to gain a lot by making the shift to cloud. Even a hybrid cloud environment can deliver substantial benefits.\nTherefore, it’s essential for any custom enterprise mobile apps to have cloud support as well. They should enable employees to pull in data from the corporate cloud and upload to it as and when required. Again, this will go a long way in speeding things up across the entire organization.\nInternet of Things Integration\nThe Internet of Things isn’t just made up of smart bulbs and doorbell cameras. There are large-scale industrial applications of smart devices that can be used to more precisely manage production processes, automate manual tasks, increase security and safety on the production floor, and more.\nOne can only get the most benefit out of an Internet of Things environment if the relevant control interfaces for these smart devices are available. If IoT has been integrated in the organization’s processes, then its mobile apps should have support for those IoT platforms as well.\nWearable Device Support\nSupport for wearable devices is another thing to consider when having a custom enterprise app developed. Smartwatches are becoming increasingly commonplace and they provide a lot of value to users as well. Many minor tasks can quickly be handled from the wrist without having to take out a smartphone or tablet.\nMany organizations also utilize custom wearable devices that are suited to specific areas of their business. These devices include smart glasses, smart headsets, tracking equipment and more.\nFind a developer for your own enterprise mobile app\nEnterprise mobile app development requires a lot of skill, particularly if you require something that’s highly complex and needs to work with existing databases and legacy systems.\nThis is not something that can be done easily and certainly not what most freelance developers can do. What you require is a professional software development firm that has a lot of experience in creating custom solutions for companies both big and small.\nZibtek has been a trusted software development services provider to Fortune 500 companies and startups alike for more than a decade. Our highly skilled developers have worked with clients to create powerful enterprise mobile apps that deliver on the high expectations set by them.\nOur development teams put the same level of effort into everything that they build, whether it's a simple app to track employee time or a full-featured inventory management app that operates on smartphones.\nAfter developing hundreds of custom apps, they have seen just about every unique use case there is, and as such bring a lot of experience to the table.\nZibtek provides an end-to-end mobile app development service for all major mobile platforms with support for advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning.\nWe can look after the entire project lifecycle, giving life to a concept and creating a fully polished product.\nContact us today to learn more about how we can create the perfect mobile app for your business.\nOur team will be happy to reach out and discuss the needs of your business and then help form a development strategy that lets you get the most value for your investment.

Businesses can leverage the power of data to make informed decisions that improve their processes, allow them to reduce costs and increase profitability. As a business scales up, it may find it difficult to sift through the mountains of data that would have been collected by then.\nThat’s why the industry relies on CRM tools to make sense of it all. Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is all about maximizing the value that can be gained from the data that a business has on its customers and clients.\nDozens of data points can be tracked and analyzed on current, potential, and former customers. The end goal of integrating a CRM tool into the operations is to get better results from all interactions with customers.\nHow does CRM work in eCommerce?\nThere has been an explosive growth in the eCommerce industry over the past decade. Entire industries that previously relied on a massive retail footprint have now gone completely online. As mobile technology has advanced and network connectivity has improved, more and more people now prefer buying things online.\nThe great thing about the very nature of eCommerce is that it provides businesses with a great opportunity to collect a lot of valuable information about every single visitor to their store in addition to their customers.\nSo even if someone lands on their store with no intent to purchase, the business will get valuable data which they can then use to target their strategies to win sales from customers who may have abandoned a purchase.\nCRM is highly beneficial for eCommerce industries as it allows for precise segmentation of data. One of the ways to win customers in this business is to utilize highly targeted ads. A CRM tool will efficiently sort the data based on which the entire online advertising strategy can be created to get the most return on investment.\nFor example, if you want to sell a product to a particular age group, simply use the CRM to find out exactly how many people in that demographic have visited your store, what they were looking for, what platform they came to your store from, etc. Take all of that to the advertising team and they will be able to create an effective strategy around it.\nIt's easy to get bogged down with information but with a CRM tool, you can only access the information that you need at that time to make a specific decision. Do you want to know how many people added a product to cart before they left? Or how many availed the new promo code? You can filter all of that information easily with the CRM.\nWhy should your eCommerce store use a CRM?\nThe time efficiency that a CRM can provide for eCommerce businesses is unmatched. Even in conventional businesses, salespeople spend only a fraction of their time on active selling. The rest of their time is spent on legwork which can include paperwork, needless meetings, and other administrative problems.\nSimilarly, there are many repetitive tasks that need to be done when running an eCommerce business. Using a CRM will streamline these workflows and automate many of the repetitive tasks so that your team isn't caught up on things that don't require 100% of their effort.\nMost eCommerce business owners make a major mistake of not analyzing their payment data. There's so much that they can obtain about their customers' buying habits just by combing through this data.\nThis is especially useful for stores that offer multiple payment channels, which the vast majority of them do. Is one payment channel performing better than the other? What's the average cart value of a new customer? At what price point are the customers more likely to abandon cart?\nBy asking yourself these questions and looking at the relevant payment data in the CRM, you can make meaningful decisions that can help grow your eCommerce business. With one click of a button, you'll be able to analyze payment trends, see who your highest value customers are, and what prices need adjusting in order to get inventory moving.\nTypes of CRMs\nOperational, Analytical, and Collaborative. These are the three main types of CRMs that are widely used in the eCommerce industry. Operational CRMs are vital for business growth. They are used to streamline the sales, marketing, and customer service processes. Order management, inventory tracking, customer queries, and more can be managed using this tool.\nAnalytical CRMs are meant for improving customer experience based on the data collection. For example, this can include their navigation patterns around the store, which can be tracked and improved to make customer flow seamless.\nLastly, Collaborative CRMs are meant to speed up information sharing within the organization. Larger eCommerce businesses have separate teams that all rely on data to get their job done. Sales would require marketing data and vice versa.\nTechnical and support teams will need to be in sync as well to ensure that customers' concerns are addressed in a timely manner. Cohesion within the organization can improve greatly once there’s a centralized location where all of the relevant data is stored and is made available to the teams instantly.\nWhat CRM works best for eCommerce companies?\nMany eCommerce giants started their journey as a one person operation in a garage. Off the shelf CRM tools can be good enough when just starting out but they aren’t not really meant to support the growth of the business in the long run. That’s why major eCommerce companies opt for fully customized CRM solutions.\nIt’s understandable why this is a preference for established eCommerce businesses. Nothing can beat a tailor-made solution. All businesses have their own unique needs. Some may require more granular control over the information being collected on their customers, others may not require certain types of data.\nReady-made tools don’t account for the differences that your business processes have compared to your competitor. As such, it can’t really lend a helping hand if you’re trying to actively improve your position in the market.\nSo it’s quite possible that you end up paying for a CRM tool that offers a lot of features but most of them remain unused because they’re not relevant to your business.\nTo be sure that the CRM tool being used is the absolute best option for your business, it would be better to opt for a custom solution. Having one developed for you from the ground up is going to be a revelation.\nYou will be able to provide the developer with your input regarding the features and functionality that you need. This will also ensure that you get the best possible bang for your buck.\nFinding the best CRM for your eCommerce business\nFinding the best CRM solution for your eCommerce business does require a fair bit of research. You need to know where to even start first. Most business owners who are just starting out and looking for a CRM tend to go with freelancers who overpromise and underdeliver.\nThis leads to costly delays, because if the tool isn’t ready, the store probably can’t be launched, and that means time and potential sales lost.\nIt’s important to work with trusted CRM consultancy providers who will take the time to understand the needs of your business and then guide you accordingly.\nThey’ll be able to call upon their vast knowledge, gained from working in the industry, and help improve upon your vision for a custom CRM tool that’s perfect for your business.\nThis is where we at Zibtek come in.

The industry’s importance has also been underscored by the COVID19 pandemic, as it enabled people to get the goods they required even when they were unable to step outside.\nWhat is eCommerce?\neCommerce, short for electronic commerce, is simply the act of buying and selling goods over the internet. There's a whole entire industry that works in the background just so customers can order that t-shirt they really like with a tap on their phone.\nThere are ecommerce platforms, data analysis services, payment processors and merchant gateways, fulfillment services and more.\nThe business-to-consumer or B2C isn't the only eCommerce model, though, it can actually be divided into six major branches. In addition to B2C, there's also B2B, in which the online sale of goods and services takes place between businesses.\nThere's also C2C in which consumers buy and sell goods between themselves.\nThere is one constant in all of these different models of eCommerce and that’s the use of the internet. Regardless of the nature of the transaction, the driving force behind it is an online platform or a portal that facilitates these deals.\nWhat you need to run an eCommerce business\nResearch is one of the most important aspects of an eCommerce business. Given the rapid growth that the industry has seen over the past decade, it has become much more difficult now to find a gap in the market. Unless proper research is not carried out, your venture may not even get off the ground.\nThere needs to be clarity on the eCommerce business model that you’ll go with. This requires a firm understanding of your target market. A website with an online store that sells directly to consumers is better suited to a boutique instead of a company that supplies industrial machinery, for example.\nBefore you get started, you'll also need to register your eCommerce business and the brand name. You can then go about securing the domain name as well as the relevant handles on social media.\nOnce your business plan has been finalized, you can start creating the online store and then ultimately drive traffic to it in order to make sales.\nThe 9 most important eCommerce development services\nThere are many important parts that make the eCommerce machine run efficiently. This includes web development, content management, payment processing, software solutions, and more. It won’t be possible to run a sustainable online business without making investments in these areas.\n1. Design concept\nYour eCommerce business needs a design concept that’s in tune with the intended audience. The right visual elements can make your online store look more appealing to customers and thus increase the chances of them actually converting.\nThe design concept needs to be applied across the entire web and mobile channels so that users have a sense of familiarity with the store regardless of the device they’re using to access it.\n2. Web development\nIt doesn’t even take a second for a visitor to jump from your online store to another site. That’s why web development is so crucial. How your online store looks is absolutely crucial for its success. Otherwise, you’ll be losing visitors before your products even have a chance of converting them into a customer.\n3. Content management\nThere are a lot of different ways through which you can bring in potential customers to your online store. A blog or online journal continues to be among the most widely used options.\nContent can tell a story and pitch the products. eCommerce development service providers can help set up a content management system for you for this purpose.\n4. Software solutions\nYou might want to automate some processes on your online store or simply make it easier for visitors to get help.\nOpt for custom software solutions that are developed with the sole purpose of meeting the needs of your business. Many online stores utilize chatbots to quickly offer support.\n5. Shopping cart\nThe online version of the ubiquitous shopping cart is actually a very powerful tool for bringing in new customers. You can have a custom shopping cart developed that provides a seamless checkout experience to customers and also surface recently viewed or similar products to capture last-minute sales.\n6. Payment gateway\nThe payment gateway is what actually executes the transaction when a customer enters their payment details on your online store. It brings that information to the payment processor used by the acquiring bank for onward processing.\nA custom payment gateway allows you to have full control of the checkout experience on your store.\n7. App development\nThe vast majority of online traffic is now driven through mobile devices. That’s why it’s so important for businesses to have a mobile app these days. Not only that, even your online presence needs to be optimized for mobile users. Adding an app to your sales channels has the potential to significantly increase sales.\n8. UX testing\nIt doesn’t hurt to have a fresh pair of eyes look at your online store. Perhaps there are improvements to be made to the user experience. Bring in experienced developers to carry out UX testing on your website or your app for that matter in order to ascertain where weaknesses, if any, exist and what would be the best way to go about fixing them.\n9. Social network integration\nSocial networks are a great traffic source for any online business, given the sheer amount of time that people spend on them these days. Having a robust social media presence is necessary, and you can also have custom integrations set up so that alerts are timely sent out through your official channels about new product launches or deals, for example.\nHow can custom software developers build out your eCommerce store?\nAs you have come to realize by now, there’s a lot that goes into running a successful eCommerce business. It’s nearly impossible to do it all by yourself, and even if someone attempts to do that, it would probably result in a half-cooked effort that would be pretty evident.\nTherefore, it’s better to rely on custom software developers so that your online store can be built out properly. Think of it this way: You wouldn’t want a shabby sign out front for your new retail space or an imperfect paint job on the inside.\nTreat your online store as you would a physical retail store, engage experts that know what they’re doing and can help guide you to make the decisions that are best for your online presence.\nYou may not be aware of different tools or software that other businesses in your industry have been using.\nAnother benefit of working with custom software developers is that they have a holistic view of the industry, since they would have worked with others in the same industry. This insight that they can bring to the table can be very valuable.\nIt can be something as simple as the positioning of a “buy now” button on your store. If they have experience from another project where a certain color or placement of the button led to an increase in sales, this would apply that to your project as well, thereby helping your chances of success.\nThe same goes for a custom shopping cart. Working with developers that have built out hundreds of online stores will enable you to leverage all of that experience. You’ll be able to learn new things and be able to make better decisions for your online store.\nZibtek can help\nThere's an obvious benefit to having a robust eCommerce experience. It makes the sales process more efficient as a result of which there's potential for the revenue to increase significantly. Having an online presence for your business is also a great way to build customer loyalty.\nWhether you're just starting out with a full-fledged digital transformation or are looking to update your online presence, Zibtek can help you become the best online business in your category.\nWe leverage our insight to help improve your existing workflow, analyze the shopping patterns of your customers to drive more value for your business.\nOur experts can help you make sense of the many eCommerce platforms available and help you pick one that works the best for your business.\nIf you'd rather have an online store built from the ground up just for you, Zibtek can help with the development work as well.

    "extractedText": "Hadoop vs. Spark\nIan J.H Reynolds\nExplore Ian J.H Reynolds' expertise in finance and economics through his insightful articles on market trends, investment strategies, and economic analysis.\nMore posts by Ian J.H Reynolds.\nIAN J.H REYNOLDS\n20 AUG 2020 • 7 MIN READ\nYou may have heard the word “big data” being thrown around quite a lot. It means what you’d expect it to mean literally. Businesses have to handle large amounts of data as they scale up and that’s also when it becomes progressively harder to extract value out of the data.\nThis is where big data analytics comes in. It specifically deals with large volumes of both structured and unstructured data that's hard to almost impossible to process with conventional methods. The insights gleaned from the analysis of this data can help with smart decision making.\nThere are several frameworks that are widely used to work with big data. Frameworks themselves are simply the toolsets that provide the solutions to the problems posed by big data processing.\nThese tools also provide insights, incorporate metadata and help in decision making. Hadoop and Spark are two of the most widely used big data frameworks.\nWhat is Hadoop?\nHadoop is one of the most popular big data frameworks in use today. Its popularity has actually made it synonymous with big data. Hadoop was one of the first frameworks of its kind which is one of the reasons why its adoption is so widespread.\nHadoop was created in 2006 by Yahoo. It was based on the Google File System and MapReduce. The company started using Hadoop on a 1000 node cluster the following year. Hadoop would then go on to be released as an open source project to Apache Software Foundation in 2008.\nWith Hadoop, it's possible to store big data in a distributed environment. This allows for the data to be processed parallelly. Hadoop has two core components that include the HDFS or Hadoop distributed File System which stores data of various formats across a cluster.\nYARN is the second component and it's tasked with resource management. It's the component that handles all of the processing activities by allocating resources and scheduling tasks. It allows parallel processing over the data.\nAdvantages\nScalability\nThe ease at which Hadoop can be scaled up is one of its biggest advantages. The framework is based on the principle of horizontal scalability. It allows storage and distribution of big data across many different servers that operate in parallel.\nIt's easy to add nodes to a Hadoop cluster on the fly which speeds up the scale at which the cluster size can grow.\nOpen Source\nHadoop is open source. What that means is that the source code for Hadoop is available for free. Anyone can take the code and modify it to suit their specific requirement without any issues. This is one of the reasons why Hadoop remains such a widely used big data framework.\nPerformance\nHadoop is capable of processing very large amounts of data at incredible speeds, made possible by its distributed processing and storage architecture. The input data files are divided into blocks that are then stored over several nodes.\nThe tasks that are submitted by the user are also divided into sub-tasks that are assigned to worker nodes and are run in parallel.\nDisadvantages\nPerturbed by small data\nHadoop is widely regarded as strictly a big data framework even though there are some other frameworks that work just as well with small data. Hadoop doesn't run into issues even when handling a small number of very large files but it can't deal with a large number of small files.\nAny file that's smaller than Hadoop's block size, which can either be 128MB or 256B, can overload the Namenode and disrupt the framework's function.\nSecurity concerns\nHadoop has remained one of the most widely used big data frameworks despite the fact that there exist some security concerns.\nThose concerns largely stem from the fact that Hadoop is written in Java which happens to be a very common programming language. It's relatively easier for cyber criminals to exploit Java vulnerabilities.\nHigher processing overhead\nHadoop is a batch processing engine at its core. All of the data is read via the disk and written to it as well. This can make the read and write operations quite expensive, particularly when the framework deals with petabytes of data.\nThis processing overhead happens because Hadoop is unable to perform in-memory calculations.\nWhat is Spark?\nSpark is also a popular big data framework that was engineered from the ground up for speed. It utilizes in-memory processing and other optimizations to be significantly faster than Hadoop. It's faster because Spark runs on RAM, making data processing much faster than it is on disk drives.\nSpark got its start as a research project in 2009. It was then open sourced in early 2020 and grew into a broad developer community in the years that followed. Spark moved to the Apache Software Foundation in 2013.\nThis general-purpose distributed processing framework can also distribute data across the cluster and then process is parallelly, much like Hadoop.\nA dedicated storage layer wasn't planned for Spark initially as the idea was to target the user base that already had their data in HDFS.\nAdvantages\nSpeed\nThe sheer speed at which Spark is able to process large amounts of data is one of its primary advantages. Data scientists prefer Spark because of its speed and the fact that it's 100x faster than Hadoop for large scale data processing. It can easily work with multiple petabytes of clustered data of over 8000 nodes at the same time.\nMultilingual\nUnlike Hadoop which is only written in Java, Spark happens to be multilingual. It works with many languages for code writing, including but not limited to Java, Scala and Python.\nThis also allows for enhanced security since code writing isn’t just limited to one language. It presents a bigger challenge to cyber criminals who look to exploit vulnerabilities in the programming languages to gain access to the framework.\nPowerful capabilities\nSpark has powerful capabilities that expand beyond what Hadoop can achieve. Its low-latency in-memory processing capability is paired with graph analytics algorithms. It also supports advanced analytics tools like streaming data, SQL queries, machine learning, and more.\nThis definitely allows an organization to get much more out of their implementation, with enhanced insights into the data allowing them to make informed business decisions rapidly.\nDisadvantages\nNo file management system\nUnlike Hadoop, which has its own file management system, Spark doesn't have one. This was a conscious choice made for the framework when it was first being engineered.\nSpark is thus dependent on other platforms like Hadoop or cloud-based storage platforms for its file management system.\nProcessing isn’t cost-efficient\nCost-efficient big data processing is an ideal that organizations chase but it can prove to be challenging with Spark. That's because of its in-memory processing. Spark requires high memory consumption.\nA lot of RAM is required for it to work as it was intended, and that can result in a higher processing cost.\nManual back pressure handling\nSpark requires manual handling of back pressure, the point when data builds up at an input-output and the buffer is full and not able to accept any incoming data. Therefore, no data is transferred until the buffer is empty. Spark can’t do that on its own and requires manual input for the flow of incoming data to be accepted once again.\nWhich should you use?\nHadoop and Spark are not mutually exclusive. There's a case to be made for a hybrid arrangement that involves the use of both. The decision to pick one over the other has to be based on a variety of factors, including but not limited to running costs, hardware and maintenance purchases.\nHadoop requires more memory on disk whereas Spark needs more RAM. Consequently, Spark clusters end up being more expensive. A balance can be struck, though, when optimizing Spark for compute time since similar tasks can be processed much faster on a Spark cluster.\nMany are of the view that Spark could end up replacing Hadoop altogether because of its raw speed. There are cases, though, where both of these frameworks can be used together. Such a hybrid arrangement can be reached in which both frameworks complement each other instead of competing.\nThis will be particularly beneficial for organizations that require batch and stream analysis for different services. Hadoop can be kept for heavier operations and it can deal with them at a lower price whereas Spark can exclusively be used to process many smaller tasks that require an immediate turnaround.\nWhen deployed in isolation, Hadoop is best suited for disk-heavy operations whereas Spark happens to be more flexible but it comes at a higher cost due to its in-memory processing. An organization that only needs a big data framework for disk-heavy operations and isn’t particularly interested in turnaround time will fare better with Hadoop.\nThose who prefer outright speed and don’t mind the higher processing costs will definitely be more satisfied with Spark. As far as the speed is concerned, there’s absolutely no comparison between the two, as Spark is proven to be 100x faster than Hadoop. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

It’s absolutely vital for all of the various departments within the organization to collaborate. They can’t exist in isolation as it is only through their joint efforts can the business goals be met.\nThere’s no shortage of software and services that make internal collaboration easier. In this day and age, it's highly important that any such service be secure, powerful and flexible. Microsoft is well aware of those business needs and it addresses them with SharePoint.\nWhat is SharePoint?\nSharePoint is a very capable collaboration and content management platform. Microsoft has developed it from the group up to make it easier to share and manage content, knowledge, and applications to increase efficiency in teamwork and to enable seamless collaboration across the organization.\nWith SharePoint, teamwork is simplified with dynamic and productive team sites for every department, project team, and division.\nThey can then share files, data, and resources among them and also customize the site to suit the team's objectives. Collaboration is possible with team members inside and outside the organization across PCs, Macs, and mobile devices.\nIt's possible to build a cohesive intranet with SharePoint. Common resources can be shared among different teams to drive efficiency for the entire organization.\nPowerful search functionality is built into SharePoint, making it easy to harness the collective knowledge of the organization in just a few clicks.\nSharePoint's success in the industry is denoted by the fact that it's used by more than 200,000 organizations across the globe with over 190 million people having SharePoint for intranets, content management, and team sites.\nHow long does it take to learn it?\nThe time that it can take to learn SharePoint depends on the skills needed. For example, if someone just wants to be able to upload documents and create pages with content in SharePoint, they'll be able to pick it up in just about a week.\nIt's obviously going to be a bit longer for developers as they will need to have programming knowledge. Developers can take anywhere from three to six months before they can take full advantage of all that SharePoint has to offer.\nThose who just want to perform admin tasks may also need to learn about the functions for at least three months. Admin functions will include things like load balancing, SharePoint configuration on servers, deployments, and more.\nThere are plenty of educational resources available online for those who are wishing to brush up on their SharePoint skills. A whole host of SharePoint training courses are also offered on the Microsoft Virtual Academy.\nHow to become certified as a SharePoint administrator\nWith SharePoint being widely used by most Fortune 500 companies, there's an increasing demand for certified SharePoint administrators.\nThe certified administrators are sought out because they have demonstrated their proficiency and have the required skills to perform the job that is expected of them.\nIt's also very easy for these businesses to verify a candidate's SharePoint credentials. They just need to ask for the unique access code and they can then view the candidate's record on Microsoft's certification website.\nMicrosoft's Modern Workplace career path is currently the only certification path offered by the company that covers SharePoint. It's further divided into three levels.\nFundamental is the initial level that's meant for those who are looking to change their career or those who are just getting started with SharePoint Server or SharePoint Online.\nAssociate is for individuals with at least 2 years of comprehensive SharePoint experience, the Fundamental level is optional for those who go for this level directly.\nExpert is the level which assumes that individuals already have up to five years of technical SharePoint experience. It's not possible to obtain an Expert level certification without first achieving the Associate level.\nExam MS-900: Microsoft 365 Fundamentals needs to be passed in order to obtain the Fundamental level certification.\nIt measures the candidate's understanding of concepts such as SaaS and PaaS, core Microsoft 365 services, pricing and support as well as security and compliance in Microsoft 365.\nThe Associate level certificate can be achieved by passing the MS-300: Deploying Microsoft 365 Teamwork exam.\nIt measures a candidate's configuration, deployment, and other relevant skills in designing and implementing Microsoft 365 services and managing overall governance and compliance for the platform.\nLastly, to obtain Expert certification, two exams need to be passed, MS-100: Microsoft 365 Identity and Services as well as MS-101: Microsoft 365 Mobility and Security. Skills in security and threat management, data migration, managing user identity and access, planning workloads, and more are tested.\nA single exam costs $165 so that's going to be the maximum cost for Fundamental and Associate level certifications, respectively. Since the Expert level requires two exams, the maximum cost is $330.\nWhat do SharePoint developers do?\nA SharePoint developer is primarily responsible for custom development. SharePoint is a very versatile platform and allows a great deal of flexibility in the value that can be extracted from it.\nThat’s why the role of SharePoint developers is so important and one of the major reasons why they’re some of the most sought after IT professionals in the industry.\nSharePoint developers can create custom document management systems, intranets, and portals. They can add functionality to these systems as per the needs of the organization.\nThis allows for a highly efficient system in which only those features that are really required to function are present with no unnecessary functionality bogging things down.\nThere's also a thriving community of developers that create add-ins for SharePoint, allowing others to quickly deploy them and expand the functionality of their portals and intranets.\nIf the business requirements dictate, they can also create custom workflows to automate processes, develop highly customized features, site templates, web parts, and more.\nOne of the great things about SharePoint is that it even allows a great degree of visual customization. Developers can create an iteration of SharePoint that doesn't look like it at all.\nThey can switch out the platform's logo, colors, style, master pages, and layouts to create a truly customized look and feel for the organization. Such customized branding is great for driving user adoption.\nIntegration is also among the key responsibilities of a SharePoint developer. They can integrate the platform with not only many of Microsoft's other products but third-party products as well.\nThis ensures that there's no disruption in business processes even when multiple business solutions are being used.\nDevelopers most commonly integrate SharePoint with enterprise management systems like CRM and ERP, learning management systems, and even social media networks like Facebook and Twitter. The possibilities are truly endless.\nDevelopment work is always required when users are to be migrated to a new SharePoint solution. The developers make sure that the transition happens without any problems.\nThen there's also the matter of training the users on the new system. Developers can help with the preparation of training manuals for the users that help them get up to speed quickly.\nMaintenance and support is another big part of the job for SharePoint professionals. There's a continuous need to provide support once the custom solution has been launched so that everything works as it was intended to.\nThis can be managing routine tasks like slow load times or installing patches to guarantee security.\nThe support function also relies upon feedback from the users regarding existing features. If something doesn’t work as it should or lacks something, the developers can quickly fix it.\nNew feature requests may also be made by users from time to time. Developers can then quickly get to work and build them so that the organization can extract the maximum value out of the platform.\nHow SharePoint certified developers can help your business\nSharePoint certified developers can help your business make the shift to this platform in the right way. The work that they do will make sure that no data is lost and users are migrated from legacy systems.\nThey can build just about any custom solution within the limitations of the SharePoint platform, allowing you to have functionality that's tailored to your unique business needs.\nZibtek, one of the world's leading software development companies, has a team of highly skilled SharePoint developers. They are experienced with both on-premises and cloud-hosted SharePoint deployments as well as the development of custom solutions.\nThese can be minor customizations like an approval workflow or a chatbot for the intranet to major projects like developing an entire intranet from the ground up.\nIt has worked with both Fortune 500 and startup companies, helping them realize their vision for the SharePoint platform within their organization.\nZibtek has offices in Salt Lake City, Utah and it also manages a global talent pool of experienced developers from its offices in the United States. Whether you’re thinking about making a switch to SharePoint or have already been using the platform and now require more functionality out of it, contact the team at Zibtek and their skilled SharePoint developers will be happy to help you out.

It’s vital to ascertain whether the software has been designed as per the requirements, whether it’s functioning as it’s supposed to and if there are any bugs or issues that need to be addressed before deployment.\nThere are many different phases of software testing. Every phase has its own place in the software development lifecycle. This further underscores the importance of testing, it’s something that simply can’t be overlooked whenever software is being developed or even when existing software is being improved with new functionality.\nWhat is regression testing?\nOne of the great things about software is that it’s not something that’s rigid, that can’t be changed once it has been developed. While some hardware products do present this challenge, software doesn’t suffer the same limitations, and it’s always possible to add more functionality to it or just to make overall improvements that help it perform better.\nThis doesn’t mean, though, that such significant changes can be made to the software without running any tests thereafter to make sure that none of the changes broke anything. It happens more often than you might think, which is why regression testing is such an important phase of software testing.\nSoftware development is a complex process and often, even the smallest of changes can end up breaking things that might cause the entire software to malfunction. If this is a software that's essential to the running of your organization, such a disruption after a new version has been deployed would cause a massive loss.\nTherefore, developers opt for regression testing whenever they tinker with existing software. The primary goal here is to make sure that the new changes didn't break anything and all of the functions that were working well previously continue to perform as they're supposed to.\nRegression testing and software development\nWhenever new code is introduced, there’s always the possibility that it might have bugs. Regression testing also enables developers to make sure that any bugs and issues are caught and fixed before the new iteration is deployed.\nWhenever new software is developed, the developers create testing scenarios to put the software through its paces before it's deployed for the first time. When carrying out regression testing later on, they can re-run the testing scenarios that were originally scripted in order to make sure that any changes that have since been introduced haven't caused a regression, in that they caused functionality that previously worked to break.\nWhat’s the difference between regression testing and retesting?\nThere's a common misconception that regression testing and retesting are one and the same. There’s actually a clear difference between the two. As previously explained, regression testing is carried out to ascertain whether new code added to software didn’t render existing features unuseable.\nYou can understand what retesting is by just focusing on the literal meaning of the word. When a test is repeated, it's a retest. The developer could just retest a test case that they just ran, a bug fix they deployed or current version functionality. Retesting is also a great way to reproduce a defect that was discovered during initial testing, which gave the developer a reason to retest in the first place.\nDefect verification is thus not possible with regression testing as only test cases that failed in the prior execution are retested. They're not included in regression testing, but test cases that passed earlier can be included in regression testing.\nUnit testing\nThere is some similarity between regression and unit testing. At its core, unit testing is very narrow in scope. It's a test that developers carry out on a small piece of code in order to verify that it's doing exactly what it's supposed to do.\nThis is actually quite useful for developers who want to catch bugs early on since they won't trickle downstream and thus testers and quality assurance experts would end up having to deal with fewer bugs.\nEach individual piece of code, such as each class or method, can be testing with this method. Developers carrying out regression testing can rely on this to. They can run their unit tests again to make sure that any of the changes introduced have not broken the units that were previously tested.\nFunctional testing\nBoth functional and regression testing are crucial parts of the testing process but they have different objectives. Functional testing is carried out with a limited scope and it's feature specific.\nFor example, if your software has a feature that allows you to track the average order value of your customers, a functional test would be carried out on this specific feature only to make sure that it's working as it should be. Such functional tests can also be performed on any of the software's other features but they're always going to be limited in their scope.\nWhat is automated regression testing?\nThe actual process of carrying out these tests can be time-consuming and repetitive, which is why many developers prefer automated regression testing. It utilizes advanced testing tools to run automated processes that carry out regression testing.\nThe tasks that are automated often include making sure that the software has been recompiled correctly, the core logic of the software is functionally correct and all other features are working as intended.\nTests on the core features and functionality have to be executed repeatedly in every regression run which is why it makes sense to automate the process. Developers generally prefer opting for the automated method for any test that would be used more than five times in the future.\nBuilding regression test scripts\nMany in the industry believe that regression testing scripts should cover up between 70 - 90% of manual tests that have proven to be effective and are repeatable. It's also pertinent to note that automated testing suites are not valid forever. The test suite has to be modified time and again in order to reflect changes that are made to the software.\nIt’s up to the testing team to make sure that obsolete test cases are isolated from the suite in order to limit the possibility of false positives on the report, a scenario where the testing suite reports a failure even when the software has none.\nWith regression test scripts, developers can exercise complete control over how the process is carried out. That’s because these scripts will only test what they’re told to. They won’t take initiative on their own to test something that the developer might have missed when they were writing the testing script. This makes it all the more important for the person who writes the testing scripts to be absolutely sure that all variations and flows are taken into account and that the script covers every possible scenario that they can think of.\nRegression testing is crucial for your business\nAny software, particularly one that’s regularly updated, will perform at its best when it’s frequently tested. There’s absolutely no way around it and for companies that invest significant amounts of resources into having custom software solutions developed, it’s crucial to have quality assurance experts on the team to handle ongoing testing.\nThat doesn’t necessarily mean that your organization has to now go out and hire a dedicated team of testers that can make sure your custom software solution always aces its tests.\nYou can instead work with companies that provide software testing services on a per-project basis. Zibtek is one of those companies. It’s one of the fastest growing software development companies in the world and counts both Fortune 500 companies and startups among its clients.\nZibtek employs expert test engineers that are an integral part of every project that the company works on. This is to ensure that the clients' deliverables always meet the strongest of quality standards. Its highly skilled quality assurance experts can carry out both automated and manual software testing to assure you of end-to-end quality.\nThey can work closely with you directly or your project manager so that you're always in the know of just how the testing process is progressing. They can work exclusively on a single project to make sure that the software test is of the highest quality.\nThey're well accustomed to using automated testing scripts as removing the human element in the process, where appropriate, proves to produce outcomes with fewer errors.\nIt doesn't matter if your project follows a waterfall methodology or is more based on the agile and scrum-based workflows, Zibtek's team can confirm their testing practices to the development standards you have chosen for your project. This is to ensure that the testing methodology matches the development cycle.\nZibtek is based in the United States, having its offices in Salt Lake City, Utah.

    "extractedText": "SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT\nSoftware QA Services\nIan J.H Reynolds\nExplore Ian J.H Reynolds' expertise in finance and economics through his insightful articles on market trends, investment strategies, and economic analysis.\nMore posts by Ian J.H Reynolds.\nIAN J.H REYNOLDS\n17 MAR 2020 • 6 MIN READ\nNo one likes bugs in their software -- especially when they show up after your software has already gone to market. From simple glitches to major security vulnerabilities, bugs can damage your reputation as a software provider and disrupt the user experience.\nOf course, there’s no avoiding bugs entirely, so it’s best to catch them early. By building a quality assurance process into your routine, you’ll reduce the risk of releasing an app or software update that contains errors.\nWhile some companies have internal QA teams, others hire external specialists, who provide a fresh eye and specialized tools to find the flaws in your programs.\nWhy do you need a software QA service?\nSoftware programs are more complex than ever, and with the pressure to continually release new updates and features, traditional testing strategies just can’t keep up.\nWhile internal user testing is an option for some companies, it won’t replace thorough QA testing. That’s because non-technical employees might be able weigh in on UI or design glitches, but they won’t find problems at the database level.\nQuality assurance services, on the other hand, specialize in uncovering bugs, and can put your product through rigorous testing, both manual and automated.\nOne company, called Ultranauts, specializes in hiring neurodiverse employees on the autism spectrum, due to their skills at pattern recognition and logical reasoning. They uncovered 56% more bugs than their client’s previous testing partner, IBM.\nQuality assurance concerns aren’t limited to reputational damage. Errors in a financial services app can lead to serious data breaches or currency rounding attacks. Trading algorithms can make rogue deals that cost companies millions.\nWhen developers are stuck cleaning up software bugs themselves, it can eat up to 75% of their time on the job. Ultimately, you simply may not have enough employees on hand to develop, test, and debug your software before bringing it to market.\nThat’s where software QA services come in.\nHow do software QA services perform quality control?\nMost QA services fall into one of two categories, manual testing and automated testing, which can be further broken down into specific types of tests.\nManual testing is when a human tester actually sits down at the computer (or mobile device) and uses the software themselves. The main benefit to manual testing is that you can get real-time feedback without having to design an automated test.\nThe downside to manual testing is that it takes time for an individual to perform the test, and there’s a greater chance of human error or inconsistent behavior.\nAutomated testing is performed using a test script that can be run repeatedly, either by focusing on a specific aspect of the program, or performing the same actions in different ways to see whether they all get the desired result.\nThe benefit to automated testing is that you can dive deep and find bugs that a human tester can’t see, while avoid the variables that comes with manual testing.\nThe downside is that the test script itself may need to be debugged, and you won’t get any feedback on the user experience, such as the colors or other visual elements.\nIn addition to these two approaches to testing, specific QA services may include:\nUnit testing: testing individual software modules\nIntegration testing: making sure the modules interact properly\nAccessibility testing: testing whether the software can be used by people who are deaf, blind, color-blind, or have other disabilities\nCompatibility testing: ensuring the software works on a range of browsers, operating systems, hardware, etc.\nPerformance testing: checking the software’s speed, load capacity, etc.\nSecurity testing: testing for security vulnerabilities\nAnd more\nThe type of testing you need will depend on what kind of software you’re developing. A thorough testing routine should ensure that the software can handle the tasks it’s meant to perform, without breaking down when something unexpected happens.\nDifferent software QA services specialize in different types of tests. Ideally, you’ll want to find one that can test your software repeatedly at different stages of development.\nSome testing services use a waterfall model, in which testing takes place only after the design period is complete, while others use an agile model, in which development and testing take place concurrently, and the software is constantly in a state of review.\nBe sure to choose a company that has experience working in your industry, and can tell you exactly what kind of testing they’ll perform and what tools they’ll use to do it.\nHere are some of the best software QA services around:\n1) Zibtek\nZibtek is a custom software development company that puts quality assurance testing at the heart of its services. It offers both manual and scripted QA testing, with a dedicated team working exclusively on your project from start to finish.\nZibtek’s approach includes automated code verification and performance testing, plus manual testing to uncover UI and navigation issues.\nBecause Zibtek also provides comprehensive development services, you can expect a faster turnaround time and shorter release cycle than less integrated companies.\nWhether you need cross-platform debugging or end-to-end testing, the team at Zibtek will put together a plan that will help you develop a user-friendly product.\nThey offer both quality assurance (QA) services, which are intended to prevent defects, and quality control (QC) services, which look for defects in the finished product.\nBoth components are key to ensuring that your deliverables meet your standards, as well as your customers’ expectations.\n2) TestFort\nTestFort has over 18 years of experience and a team of over 160 QA engineers. They offer functionality, usability, performance, security, and compatibility testing. In addition to services for websites and mobile apps, they also provide testing for cloud software, Internet of Things, games, and more.\nThey create thorough testing reports to ensure that your developers can look back at old code and see what was tested and which issues were addressed.\nThey offer both manual and automated testing services, and can test your software on over 250 different devices to guarantee cross-platform usability and security.\nFinally, they can work alongside your in-house QA team, provide a full testing team of their own, or consult with your company to create a long-term testing plan.\n3) Oxagile\nOxagile provides QA testing for desktop and mobile apps, with dedicated testing teams available to work exclusively with a single client for complex long-term projects.\nThey offer localization testing, which ensures that your product is ready for delivery in a specific region (for example, with the appropriate language, time format, and keyboard), as well as security audits, performance testing, and more.\nThey have experts in business intelligence who can run OLAP and warehouse testing, as well as specialized testing for AI, healthcare, finance, and the Internet of Things.\nThey can incorporate the waterfall process for smaller QA projects, but typically rely on scrum-based workflows with sprint planning and post-sprint reviews.\n4) DeviQA\nDeviQA is a comprehensive software testing company that prioritizes data security and storage, and the integrity of intellectual property.\nWhen you request a quote, DeviQA will sign an NDA and create a free proof of concept outlining their strategy and the automated code they’ll use to test your software. Based on an initial trial, you can decide whether or not to sign up as a long-term client.\nChoose from a fixed-price project for a one-time performance or stress test, a dedicated team that will work on the project with you, or a “time and materials” model in which you pay an hourly rate for deliverables, with no ongoing commitment.\nDeviQA can begin work on your project in as little as 12 hours, and provide daily reports and statistics keeping you informed on the progress of your testing.\nThey also offer DevOps services including continuous delivery, container management, and infrastructure monitoring, to help you deploy your projects more efficiently.\n5) QA Madness\nFinally, there’s QA Madness, a newer company based in Lithuania that provides cloud testing, localization testing, non-functional testing, and more.\nThey specialize in testing for e-commerce platforms, including WooCommerce, Shopify, and Magento, as well as video games, VR and AR software, and wearables.\nThey can create a thorough testing strategy with in-depth scenarios and test cases, or provide an ad-hoc approach, which involves running random tests to check for glitches when you’re on a tight timeframe and don’t have the time for end-to-end testing.\nThey also have experience working with e-learning platforms, big data, and blockchain testing, and can apply their expertise in dozens of industries and locations.\nGet a developer who can stand up to the most scrupulous quality control practices.\nNo developer can promise to entirely eliminate bugs from the development process. But a good developer knows how to work with a QA team to fix bugs as quickly as possible, and take a proactive approach to reducing further errors.\nRemember, QA testing isn’t a one-time thing, but an ongoing part of the development process. With Zibtek, you can feel confident that QA testing isn’t an afterthought -- it’s built right into what we do, from code verification to continuous integration.

    "extractedText": "SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT\nDos and Don'ts of Customer Self-Service Portals\nIan J.H Reynolds\nExplore Ian J.H Reynolds' expertise in finance and economics through his insightful articles on market trends, investment strategies, and economic analysis.\nMore posts by Ian J.H Reynolds.\nIAN J.H REYNOLDS\n2 JAN 2020 • 5 MIN READ\nCustomer service has changed. Customers’ expectations have changed. People want to do things themselves. A recent survey found that 88% of people contacted in the United States and globally expect the brands or organizations they interact with to have self-service portals. Having an excellent self-service portal—a place where customers, vendors, and employees can carry out transactions, get information, or obtain customer support—is now a critical part of doing business.\nTwo industries where self-service portals are especially important are Banking/financial services and healthcare. Consumers expect to be able to access their vital information and interact with their service providers 24/7, no matter where they are.\nThe quality of your self-service portal is a major, if not the primary way in which others interact with your company. That makes the quality of that experience a direct reflection on your brand. Giving people a good experience is just one of the advantages of self-service portals. Other reasons to build and develop them include:\nPeople are asking for ways to interact online; they expect it.\nOnline self-service portals are always available, 24/7.\nSelf-service, when done right, can reduce costs and deliver information and support more efficiently.\nWhen people interact with your brand through a portal, they feel more engaged, and it can create a sense of community.\nIt allows you to collect valuable, accurate data on how your customers behave and interact while they’re on your site.\nOnline interaction allows people to share documents, images, and videos much more efficiently.\nWith such strong justification, your company is most likely interested in creating or improving your portal. To help with that, we present the following dos and don’ts for self-service portals:\nDos: How to increase the value of your online customer service experience\nThe goal of an online self-service portal is to allow people to access information, execute a transaction, or obtain support quickly and easily. That may be personal information, an IT help desk, or providing registration for webinars. The applications for self-service portals are wide and varied.\nBased on our years of experience in creating and optimizing self-service portals, we have six recommended “rules:”\nSelf-service portals should be intuitive\nThe user experience needs to be as easy as possible. If your customers run into anything complicated or confusing, they may develop a negative impression. Take the time to test your workflows early and throughout the process. Also, once up and running, use data on user behavior (see Do #5 below) to identify areas where users are spending time or exiting the application before the workflow is completed; these are signs of a non-intuitive process.\nUser experience should be mobile-first\nMobile is becoming the preferred way for people to interact with online content. Your site must provide a seamless, positive experience from mobile to desktop and back to mobile.\nYour site should be able to search\nIf your website is powered with a search feature—and it should be—test, test, and test again to ensure your information is easy to find. Which keywords do your visitors use to find you? Include strong a search engine in your site as well as natural language processing.\nEnable customer feedback\nAn online platform should offer ways for your users to provide feedback on the self-service experience. Then, you can use this information to constantly improve it.\nTrack what your users are doing\nTracking users uncovers which areas they use the most and where they are struggling. Use that information to fix or improve things. This type of data is invaluable for finding cumbersome or non-intuitive user interface issues. Seeing where customers spend most of their time also provides you with data on where you should focus your efforts on improving your tools.\nReflect your brand\nDon’t treat your online self-service portal as something separate from your company’s branding. From password reset to searching a knowledge base, make sure it not only looks like the rest of your content but also keeps your messaging consistent across your online presence.\nDon’ts: What you should avoid in your digital support platform\nSometimes creating a great user experience that delivers value to your company and your customers, employees, or vendors involves avoiding specific problems on a site. For a self-service portal, this can be even more important, especially if the portal is offering support. Here are six suggestions for what you should avoid, based on our experience in helping customers create their self-service portals:\nDon’t frustrate your users.\nIt is never a good idea to frustrate people, but that is especially true when you are asking them to serve themselves. Avoiding user frustration should be your number one priority. So listen carefully to—and solicit!—feedback.\nDon’t make users enter data you already have.\nSpeaking of frustrating users, making them enter personal data that your company already has can be annoying. Let them see what you have available and let them add or modify—for example, enable an auto-fill feature so users can add previously-entered details with just one click should they choose to.\nDon’t hide your humans.\nEven though users want to be able to use a self-service site, we have found that they do not like having online access and self-service content as the only option. Don’t make it difficult for them to find contact information for email, phone, or chat.\nDon’t ignore older content and let it become stale\nAn excellent self-service portal will have useful content, and over time that content will build up. Don’t let it get too old. Make sure that your team reviews the site, removes obsolete tools and information, and updates content that still has value.\nDon’t advertise or sell too obviously.\nAvoid coming off as too “salesy” on your portal, even if users are coming to your site as part of the sales process. They want to learn or undertake a transaction. They do not want to be sold to.\nDon’t require a login to access useful information\nIf you put helpful content—like FAQs and knowledge base articles—behind a login on your portal, you are hiding it from search engines and users who are researching your product or service. That said, we realize that form-fills are great ways to build your lead pipeline, so we recommend mapping your customers’ journey to understand their needs and preferences, which we’ll get to next.\nBuilding your best self-service portal\nNow that you know what to do and what not to do, it is time to begin developing your new portal or an upgrade to your existing site. An excellent place to start is mapping out your customer’s journey. Below is the customer journey map we use when we help customers plan their users’ experience.\nAs with any software development process, you should next plan out what you want to do. Start with a list of the services you want to offer to your users, then assign priority to each based upon how much time they take up now and how often users want to access each feature.\nThe next step is to find the right development team. It would help if you had someone that understands how to work with you to create the right experience and deliver the value available in a well-implemented self-service portal. At Zibtek we know how to do that as well as how to write useful applications for the web and mobile that can grow and improve with time. We also provide support to your team after launch to make sure things keep running, and add the right enhancements when needed.\nIn business, everyone always talks about how important it is to keep your customers, employees, and partners happy. As digital transformation takes hold and more and more of the interaction that is critical to your business takes place online, the companies that thrive and grow will be the ones that turn that talk into action through outstanding self-service portals. We hope our suggestions above will help you with your journey.

    "extractedText": "SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT\nTop Programming Trends for 2020\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n17 SEP 2019 • 6 MIN READ\nTechnology is evolving faster than ever in this digital landscape. To maintain a competitive edge in the marketplace, it is essential for enterprises to keep themselves up-to-date with the latest trends. In this article, we are going to list out the top programming tech predictions for 2020 that will drive disruption and improve business opportunities.\n# 6. Rust\nRust is the system programming language that is empowering developers to build efficient and reliable applications. Syntactically, Rust is similar to C++, but it provides better memory security and higher performance. According to StackOverflow, Rust is the most loved programming language.\n(image source: StackOverflow)\nWhy choose Rust as a programming language?\nUsually, the programming language performance depends on the data structure and algorithms used by the developers. However, it is believed that Rust performs better than other Just In Time (JIT) and interpreter languages.\nRust has a very precise and accurate compiler that checks every variable, memory address and reference in the code. This ensures memory safety throughout your code.\nBusiness use case for Rust\nLibra, Facebook’s new programming language environment and global cryptocurrency, is built on Rust. Because Rust is an extremely fast, robust, well-designed language that makes the project development fun, it was a good fit for the project.\n# 5. Progressive web apps (PWA)\nProgressive Web Applications (PWA) combine modern technologies with best practices for building top quality applications.\nThese applications:\nAre reliable and have a significantly reduced loading time.\nNever breaks, even in uncertain network conditions.\nQuickly respond to the user’s request or actions.\nHave a great user experience.\nPWA Google trends report shows an amazing growth of PWA from the year 2014 to 2019.\n(https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?cat=5&date=today%205-y&q=%2Fm%2F011spz0k)\nPWA: The future of applications\nIn traditional native applications, users are required to go into the app store, find an app, accept permissions and wait for the app to download. This process consumes so much of the users’ time. Whereas, with PWA, users are only required to go to Google, search and find the website. And the application is immediately launched into your PWA.\nWith PWA, JavaScripts and Service workers run separately from the main thread, allowing PWA to load instantly even in poor network connection. PWAs provide smooth navigation, animations, and scrolling within the web pages.\nPWAs are safe and secure. Your customers’ sensitive information, including debit card and credit card details, are secure with PWAs.\nBusiness use case of PWAs\nThe following industries have implemented PWAs and have seen a remarkable increase in their sales and revenue:\nFlipkart has a 40% higher conversion rate and 3 times more user engagement on its website.\nUnited eXtra Electronics increased its re-engagement by 4 times.\n5miles increased its conversion by 30% and decreased the bounce rate by 50%.\nAliExpress increased its conversion rates by 104%.\n# 4. GraphQL\nGraphQL is a query language for APIs. It offers a complete and precise description of the data in API. It is considered a much better approach than traditional REST APIs. Unlike traditional REST APIs, GraphicQL loads all the data required by your app in just a single request.\nCompanies that used GraphQL\nFacebook, GitHub, Pinterest, Intuit and more\nGraphQL Google trend\nIn order to fetch the data, you just need to send a GraphQL query to API. GraphQL always gives predictable and accurate results. Let’s have a look.\nCode snippet: To fetch the data (name, height, and mass), GraphicQL sends the query to API\n{\nhero {\nname\nheight\nmass\n}\n}\nCode snippet: Result returned by GraphicQL displaying the name of the person, his height and mass\n{\n\"hero\": {\n\"name\": \"Luke Skywalker\",\n\"height\": 1.72,\n\"mass\": 77\n}\n}\n# 3. WebAssembly (WASM)\nIn layman language, WebAssembly is the binary format that takes code (written in any programming language) and runs that code in a web browser. It is the compilation target for high-level languages, such as Rust, C++, C and more. The term “compilation target” here means-\nDevelopers write the code in any language.\nAnd the code will be compiled into WebAssembly and run on the web browser.\nIn the web browser, the code will be translated into native machine code.\nWith WebAssembly, the code executes at high speed.\nAreas where WebAssembly is used\nImage and video editing\nLive video augmentation\nImage recognition\nCAD applications\nDeveloping tools (compiler, editor, debuggers)\nNative apps on mobile devices\nServer-side applications\nScientific visualizations\nWebAssembly makes applications run faster\nSome business cases of the companies that used WebAssembly to make their applications faster:\nMozilla Firefox claims that as compared to JavaScript, WebAssembly compiles and executes the code faster.\nFigma has used WebAssembly to reduce their website loading time by more than 3 times.\n# 2. React\nReact is the most popular JavaScript library built by Facebook. It is used for building user interface (UI) components for web applications. It enables developers to create amazing interactive UIs seamlessly. With React, you are just required to design simple views for your application. Everything else, such as updating and rendering the right components whenever data changes in your application, is managed by React. Also, React makes your code easier to test and debug while making your code more predictable.\nAccording to the npm survey, React currently has a 60% market share. Have a look.\nIndustry giants who are using React\nFacebook\nFacebook has used React to build its webpages. Also, its mobile app is built using React Native (a version of React).\nThe ReactJS library was initially created by Facebook only.\n2. Instagram\nInstagram has implemented React in almost every feature and component of it, including search engine accuracy, Google APIs, geolocations and more.\n3. Netflix\nNetflix has used React in its platform called Gibbon (a rendering engine by Nextflix that is used to craft high-performance TV UIs).\nIn one of the blog posts of Netflix, one UI engineer says, “our decision to adopt React was influenced by a number of factors, most notably: 1) startup speed, 2) runtime performance and 3) modularity”\n# 1. JavaScript\nJavaScript was developed by Brendan Eich in 1995. It has become an ECMA standard (a standard for scripting language) in 1997. JavaScript is the most popular scripting language for web-based applications. It is an interpreted, lightweight or just-in-time compiled programming language that is packed with a wide variety of functions and libraries.\nAccording to GitHub repositories, JavaScript has the most contributors in private and public repositories across the world.\n(image source: octoverse.github.com)\nSome examples of applications or things that you can build using JavaScript:\nWeb applications\nVirtual reality\nDrones\nIoT applications\nGaming applications\nMobile applications\nWeb server\nWhy JavaScript?\nStrong community support\nJavaScript has a huge and robust community that assists in the development and maintenance of the software.\nRich library\nJavaScript has a rich library packed with amazing features that helps developers build amazing applications while speeding up the development process.\nExceptionally fast\nApplications built with Javascript are exceptionally fast. JavaScript ensures a great user experience by rendering the features of the applications (including animations, UIs) quickly.\nEasier testing and debugging\nBeing an interpreted language, JavaScript makes testing and debugging fun. In JavaScript, it is easy for the developers and testers to find the defect in an application, debug it and test it again.\nCost-effective\nMost of the JavaScript frameworks are open-source (no licensing fees required to use it) and available for free. This, in turn, eliminates the cost of product licenses and subscriptions.\nCompanies that used JavaScript\nMicrosoft: Microsoft used JavaScript to build its Edge web browser.\nPayPal: PayPal used Javascript in its online payment interface.\nNetflix: A huge portion of the Netflix interface is running on JavaScript.\nGoogle: Google used Javascript in its Google Docs and Gmail applications.\nZibtek is always on top of the latest trends. Our engineers deploy across 75 programming languages and care constantly retraining. For more information about tech trends and how emerging technologies can work for your business, contact us today.

It starts with clarity: understanding what you’re building, when you need it, and your expected app development cost. This blog is your 2025 roadmap to making smarter, faster hiring decisions—whether you’re considering a freelancer, assembling an in-house team, or partnering with a proven firm like Zibtek.\nWe’ll cover how to identify qualified developers, what separates average from exceptional, and how to evaluate talent beyond the resume. Whether you're a startup founder building an MVP or a product leader scaling enterprise software, this guide gives you the tools to make confident choices. Most importantly, you'll see why Zibtek stands out as the partner businesses trust to deliver quality, speed, and long-term value.\nStep 1: Understand What You Need Before You Start Looking\nBefore you begin searching for an app developer for hire, define your requirements. This will help you avoid mismatches and wasted effort, and it will significantly narrow down the talent pool to only those who fit your vision.\nTable on Understand What You Need Before You Start Looking\nTip: Having clarity on these technical needs makes it easier to evaluate whether a potential developer or agency is equipped to handle your vision.\nAt Zibtek, we believe in starting with strategy. Our team helps you define scope, tech stack, and success metrics upfront, so the development journey is smooth, focused, and aligned from day one.\nStep 2: Where to Find Top App Developers\nThere are several channels you can explore when looking for top app developers—each with its own strengths and risks.\nDeveloper Marketplaces\nFreelance platforms like Upwork, Toptal, and Fiverr offer global access to independent developers. While some clients have success here, vetting quality, ensuring long-term accountability, and managing freelancers effectively often becomes a burden, especially if you lack technical oversight on your team.\nDeveloper Communities\nCommunities like GitHub, Stack Overflow, and even Reddit can help identify active developers by showcasing their code, discussions, and contributions. But this approach still requires time-consuming outreach, evaluation, and management.\nReferrals and Personal Networks\nGetting referrals from colleagues, founders, or investors may lead to trustworthy leads. However, these are usually limited in number and may not match your exact technical or project-specific needs.\nPartner with Zibtek: A Strategic Shortcut\nInstead of sourcing, vetting, and managing developers on your own, working with Zibtek gives you immediate access to a global network of rigorously screened professionals. We match you with top app developers based on your project’s unique requirements—backed by proven processes, technical oversight, and dedicated project management.\nUnlike transactional platforms, Zibtek works as an extension of your team. Whether you need to outsource mobile app development or scale an internal team quickly, we provide stability, transparency, and senior-level talent under one roof.\nStep 3: How to Evaluate App Developers Like a Pro\nOnce you’ve identified a pool of potential candidates, the evaluation phase is where the real work begins—and where most businesses falter.\nStart with their technical portfolio. Don’t just look at design or functionality—evaluate the performance, scalability, and architecture of past work. A strong developer should be able to explain why they made specific decisions, what trade-offs were involved, and how the product delivered on business goals.\nBeyond technical capability, communication plays a pivotal role. A great developer doesn’t just write clean code—they ask the right questions, flag issues early, and collaborate closely with product owners. Misalignment here often leads to delays and rework.\nYou can also test developers through small paid pilot tasks or mini-projects. These real-world tests will quickly reveal their problem-solving skills, responsiveness, and ability to work within constraints. Look at the quality of code documentation, adherence to deadlines, and how well they understand the business logic—not just the codebase.\nNot all developers are created equal. What sets top app developers apart is their ability to think beyond code.\nAt Zibtek, every developer undergoes a multi-tiered assessment process—covering code quality, architectural thinking, communication, and collaboration. We don’t just assess whether they can code; we evaluate whether they can ship product-ready software within real-world conditions.\nStep 4: In-House vs. Outsourcing – What’s Right for You?\nThis is a common crossroad for companies: should you build an in-house team or outsource app development?\nIf speed, budget control, ongoing scalability, and access to specialized talent are priorities, outsourcing provides clear advantages. Building an internal team takes time and adds long-term overhead, while outsourcing gives you access to senior talent without inflating your app development cost. In contrast, outsourcing with a reliable partner like Zibtek gives you an experienced, fully functional team within days.\nOur clients often come to us after spending months trying to build or manage teams themselves, only to face missed deadlines, communication gaps, or technical debt. By partnering with Zibtek, they fast-track development, minimize risk, and stay focused on core business objectives.\nWith Zibtek, you don’t just outsource mobile app development—you extend your in-house capabilities with a proven, accountable partner.\nWhy Choose Zibtek to Hire Top App Developers?\nZibtek Employee.\nFinding top app developers isn't just about filling roles—it’s about finding the right partner to execute your product vision with precision.

    "extractedText": "CUSTOM SOFTWARE\nWhy You Should Love Custom Software Development?\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n12 JUL 2019 • 6 MIN READ\nWhat is custom software development?\nCustom software development is the process of designing, deploying and maintaining software that meets the specific requirements of an individual or group of users in an organization. It is usually developed by in-house developers or outsourced to a third-party contractor. Such software is primarily created to target the specific needs of businesses. It is commonly built with the purpose of serving in-house users, not for reselling the product on the market.\nThe graphs below show the market size of custom software development services from the years 2013 to 2018 and 2019 to 2024.\nThe market size of custom software development\nImage credit: www.anythingresearch.com\nFuture market of custom software development\n(Image credit: www.anythingresearch.com)\nThese graphs represent that:\nFrom the year 2013 to 2018, the total market size of custom software development services has increased.\nFrom the year 2019 to 2024, the future market of custom software development services is expected to grow.\nBefore drilling into details about why custom software development service is best for your business, let’s discuss-\nWhat is off-the-shelf software?\nHow is it different from custom software development?\nWhat is off-the-shelf software?\nOff-the-shelf software is a pre-packaged solution that is ready-made and available to the general public for sale and distribution. Instead of catering to the needs of specific users, it is built for a wide range of users with a standard predefined framework and design. The way it is designed enables you to seamlessly integrate the software with your existing system. It does not necessarily require customization, as it is created keeping a large variety of audience in mind. For example, the MS-Word application is designed as a diverse solution for a large number of users.\nCustom software vs off-the-shelf software\nCustom software\nOff-the-shelf software\nCustom software development provides you the option to make changes according to your business needs, as it targets a specific set of users.\nOff-the-shelf software aims to target a broad set of requirements for a mass audience, making it impossible for you to customize the software according to your specific business requirements.\nThe customized solution addresses your exact business needs. Since it is designed specifically for you, all of its features and functionalities are essential for your business.\nOff-the-shelf software is designed for a large variety of users, so it may only meet only 70-80% of your business needs. For example, an average MS-Word user deploys only 20-30% of its features.\nWhy custom software development?\nAddress your unique business needs\nA wide variety of ready-made software solutions (off-the-shelf software) are available on the market. And these solutions are often publicized as “one-size-fits-all”. But every business has its unique process and requirements, having different problems that need to be solved. Therefore, the “one-size-fits-all” concept is not applicable when it comes to the software that you need to address your business issues. In order to cater to your specific business goals, you should invest in a customized software solution. This will increase your business efficiency and productivity. Choosing custom software development doesn’t only provide you the opportunity to grow your business, but it also means you won’t have to settle for less than a complete solution.\nFor example, you may want a business analytics software that can:\nCollect and analyze the data of people from all over the world who are visiting your website.\nPresent those data in the form of graphs and charts.\nMonitor all your business metrics and share business related details amongst team members, without violating confidentiality.\nOff-the-shelf software may not be able to meet all these business requirements. To reach your specific goal, you can choose a custom software development company that can customize your software solution according to your business needs.\n2. Seamless integration with different systems and technology\nWith the off-the-shelf solution, integration with other software packages is not always a smooth process. You may have to struggle to come up with a working solution to integrate various technologies. Whereas custom software is designed and developed in a way that it can easily integrate with other software solutions without displaying errors. This, in turn, will optimize your business operations and enhance your employees’ productivity.\nFor example, suppose you have customized business analytics software. You can easily integrate it with other software solutions, including e-mail management, social media management tools, Customer Relationship Management software (CRM) and more.\nLook at the major challenges faced by software development companies-\n(Image credit: GoodFirms)\nThe given image shows 6.5% of companies find difficulty in integrating the existing software with different software solutions. But custom software development addresses this integration issue. It provides flexibility when it comes to integrating customized software with other software packages or technologies.\n3. Easier to scale\nBuying an off-the-shelf software for your business needs may not be a good idea if your company is growing. Your business requirements change when your organization grows. In the future, if you want to scale your business, then there is a chance that off-the-shelf software:\nWill not be able to support your business operations.\nWill not be able to meet your new business requirements that keep changing with the company’s growth.\nBecomes too expensive to license.\nWhile the off-the-shelf software is built according to the standard industry requirements, the custom software is built keeping in mind the specific requirements and objectives of your business. The custom software solution can easily scale with your growing business. You can easily scale and customize your business process without creating new challenges for your team.\nTime taken to develop custom software\nTime taken to develop custom software depends on the project’s requirements, business objectives and technology to be used in the project. According to recent surveys, an average time period to develop software is 4 to 5 months. Have a look at the software development survey chart given below:\nAs you can see in the software development survey chart:\n7.70% of custom software development firms take less than 2 months to deliver a software with basic features and functionalities.\n38.50% of developers deliver the software in the time period of 2-4 months.\n61.60 % of developers take 4-5 months to design, develop and deliver the software. This is the average time period to develop software.\n15.40% of custom software development companies deliver a quality software solution, with maintenance and support, in the time span of more than 6 months.\nIn custom software development, developers have to build the software from scratch instead of deploying a ready-made software. Therefore, designing and developing the custom software solution is a time-consuming process in the beginning. However, it is worth the initial investment because it will save a lot of your time when you want to scale your business. Your custom software development expert can easily customize the solution according to your new business requirements.\n4. Cost-effective approach\nPurchasing off-the-shelf software requires you to set-up additional hardware to run efficiently. You can reduce these additional hardware costs with custom software development. Before building a custom solution, every aspect of your business (including the current hardware compatibility and their capabilities) are taken into consideration. Therefore, you don’t need to buy additional hardware in order to make it compatible with your custom software solution.\nIn the short term, ready-made software is almost always cheaper. But in the long run, custom software development is less expensive and a more cost-effective approach. Unlike off-the-shelf software, custom software is developed to support your business process. It doesn’t force you to adopt the software the way it is. You are free to make changes in the software if you feel any feature is missing that is essential for your business. In the future, if you want to expand your business, then you can easily scale your custom solution to meet your new business requirements.\n5. Ongoing support from software development experts\nEmploying a custom software development team gives you the advantage of direct contact with developers who designed the software. In this way, you can get comprehensive answers regarding the software more efficiently. Your software needs to evolve when your company grows. The business expansion comes with new problems and challenges. Your custom software development team will help you to address these problems and challenges. You can work with the development team to customize the software according to the new requirements.\nWith years of modernizing and empowering businesses of every size with custom software development, Zibtek can be the partner to help you build a customized solution for your business.

    "extractedText": "BUSINESS\n10 Challenges To Think About When Upgrading Legacy Systems\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n10 JUN 2019 • 5 MIN READ\nMany organizations have an old legacy system still in use. If options have not been considered, or if an entrepreneur is unwilling to alter the way something has always been accomplished, it can be hard to change business processes. There are many and varied difficulties associated with legacy migration initiatives. They depend on the scope of the method of migration. The challenges a migration project faces also depends on the state and nature of a legacy scheme that needs to be updated. But, even so, moving forward and upgrading to new technology that best fits the requirements of a company is crucial. The primary objective of this article is to define the most challenging issues when upgrading a legacy system in the business.\nWhat is a legacy system?\nLegacy means that the system is outdated or needs replacement, but it may be in excellent working order so that the company or owner will not upgrade and prefers to still keep it in use.\nLegacy systems can also be linked to terminology or procedures that no longer apply to present situations or content, generating confusion.\n10 Challenges To Think About When Upgrading From Legacy Systems\n1. Cost:\nIt is a challenge for a business to deal with the cost when looking for adoption of new technology or software. That is why it has become so critical to invest in standards-based technology. If the company is spending more on a legacy system in the initial stage, it may be difficult for the company to operate in the future. As hard as these costs may be for economic decision-makers to justify, there may also be a feeling of wanting to safeguard the initial investment made. That is why it has become so critical for the company to invest the full number at the beginning.\n2. Adaptability:\nIt is a big challenge for the company to face when they are looking for modernization. Typically, legacy users are comfortable with their system. Hence, they may find it difficult to adapt after the software migration. In order to overcome this problem, the company needs to explain to the user the advantages, features and shortcut updates on the new software, and the changes that the company can see through this. It is also important to take feedback from the user committee. The feedback can be collected and analyzed and the results will help the organization to make necessary changes.\n3. Workflow issues:\nThis is another challenge for an organization, changing legacy tech software is the hardest thing for the organization. Beyond other technical problems, employee engagement is the primary issue. Employees find it difficult to get adapted to the changes in the legacy system; employees should be trained on the new changes that have been enforced by the organization. If this is not resolved properly there can be a legacy creep. This leads to a lack of employee interest towards workflow and their productivity goes down.\n4. Integration\nThe greatest challenge is to incorporate new changes into current legacy technologies (web application, mobile app) instead of starting with a whole new platform. Few companies still use their company legacy system. Mapping all these connectors is essential and ensuring that key functionality is maintained through replacement.\n5. Time:\nWhen changing technology the organization needs to consider a few steps. The first step should always be to analyze fully what the company requires. You can define an appropriate substitute by fully understanding what a good system would look like and how a contemporary solution can provide the necessary flexibility, agility, and inclusion. This is a little time consuming when time seems to be an important factor for every organization.\n6. Reduce the disruption:\nIt is impossible to underestimate the potential effect on employees. During and after the migration, users must be prepared to perform vital business processes. In addition to supporting all the current procedures, it also should support the new system for user expectations. For employees, the migration must be as painless as possible, or the IT staff may be inundated with emails and phone calls from dissatisfied employees seeking assistance. Depending upon the complexity of the legacy system, timing and the scope need to be closely considered in order to minimize the disturbance.\n7. Changing management:\nBy helping your organization through the changes, you need to be sure that the demands you receive throughout the migration are real and that they have actionable outcomes throughout your entire company. Changes should not help the process, it should also be beneficial to the organization as well as to the end users.\n8. Reframing the old structure:\nIn older schemes that are still based on outdated methods, this can be a large challenge. You will need to construct complicated mappings to be able to restructure the ancient framework of your legacy scheme to map the new environment. The key here is eliminating manual tasks that can be managed with automation.\n9. Data Loss:\nIf information is accessible in the legacy system but is not accessible in the target scheme after the migration process, it is called data loss. In data migration, information loss is the greatest danger. Because of bad information, the cost engaged in rectifying data loss and company costs contributes to the economic and reputation damage. Comparing the number of documents in the legacy system and target scheme will provide a reasonable evaluation of migration data loss. It is not possible to always match the number of legacy records and the number of destination system information; business rules may exist to dismiss documents based on certain parameters. When using such guidelines, the number of documents in the legacy system should match the number of documents rejected plus the number of documents in the destination scheme.\n10. Open communication:\nInnovation does not necessarily eliminate positions, but when introducing new tech, fear can cause confusion. It is essential to clarify practical applications of new systems when unplugging legacy systems to relieve issues and drive support for the move. This strategy provides workers with knowledge about what is “under the hood” so that they can see how something new helps them do their jobs better rather than eliminating their position.\nConclusion:\nMigration is a routine part of every business operation in today’s business environment. Even so, as a consequence of data quality or application performance problems, it often creates significant disturbance and can have a severe effect on budgets. Organizations need a reasonable and reliable methodology to avoid these problems. Hence, the above challenges would help the organizations to upgrade the legacy system. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

    "extractedText": "BUSINESS\n9 Ways to Improve Your Company’s CRM System\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n30 MAY 2019 • 5 MIN READ\nCompanies using CRM should know how they can improve their CRM system. Employees play a major role here in making improvements and realizing a return on investment (ROI). People working for the sales and marketing team need to focus on every possible way that they can improve their CRM. Applying all the factors outlined below in your business will bring you a great result for your company.\nWhat is CRM?\nCRM stands for customer relationship management. A CRM system enables organizations to create client interactions and streamline procedures so that revenues can be increased, client service improved, and profitability increased.\n1.Employees training on CRM:\nIt is essential that each employee be consistently trained to use the CRM effectively. By implementing the process, this strategy will ensure proper efficiency. It is necessary for the employees to know what the clients need and to understand how the process works and how the process operates. The two facts that employees should know are:\n*Regional knowledge\n*Technological knowledge\nLocal awareness monitors present data about clients and attempts to create a new company. Those staff with extensive experience operating on CRM will have a structured process leading to revenues and earned income.\nTechnological understanding makes it easy for staff to comprehend the significance of CRM using distinct teaching methods and techniques. As this is time-consuming, it can introduce various learning models under CRM, but it enables teams to attain a long-term goal. CRM is an investment for the business, so employee participation is essential, and they should know how it operates.\n2. To strengthen all CRM communications:\nEmployees need to understand that modifications to the system are anticipated; for this two-way communication is needed. Employees should feel comfortable raising questions and making necessary changes. They also need to check if full information is obtained into CRM. It is a significant platform not only for one but for many consumers to function and to interact. The employees should have a clear picture of the business goals and should be more organized. It is necessary to know if employees have the required knowledge to work with the system. Hence, stand up calls, weekly updates, or quarterly meeting with employees would benefit the organization as well as the staff. Using multiple channels for communication will encourage the employees to actively engage in the conversation.\n3. Trace client conduct throughout the entire sales cycle:\nIf you don’t measure, you can’t manage. Tracking what a client does is crucial for the marketing representative. Employees should keep track of where your customers access information, what kind of device they use, from where the content is taken, with what segment of content they are engaged, for how many days and how often they return, and with whom they share that content. This enables you to understand the present requirements of your clients and their future needs. Providing staff the relevant information about the process will ultimately lead to success.\n4. Maintain up-to-date data:\nFor a company to improve its CRM, it needs to execute ways to protect and cultivate the data this creates a healthy database as the need grows in the future.\nIs it easy to maintain a record like that? No! It’s not as simple as CRM can do, it’s hard for a sales representative to have a detailed record of working along with lead. But it is possible to have precise information with the help of CRM.\nA sales representative should be very careful about the data gathered, understand that the information collected should be correct, remove poor messages and duplicate data, flag the invalid emails, and maintain the file tidily. They should often stay in touch with your connections, this reduces the risk of emails going cold. The decision made from the CRM system can be strong and powerful only if the data are completely available in the system.\n5. Get in sync:\nCRM should let employees into schedule appointments with clients send an invite through Google calendar and mobile phones to know that we have recorded an event for a specific date and time. CRM should be able to monitor on a continuous basis and keep a record of cold and warm leads, changes and cancellations of leads, they should know their active leads without the sales rep keeping a double entry on them, then it is said to be a good CRM system. If not, it is difficult to get the accurate result which brings sales.\n6. Mobile:\n![Mobile-development-app]\nAs technology grows easier the work goes more smoothly. We all know today the sales team also use their smartphones, iPad, and tablets in closing deals. This would really bring a major change to business as they can access the information from anywhere, any time; also they can receive updates or notifications of appointments. This will help in company productivity as the employees who visit in and out often will be able to access the device. The employees need to be trained on how the software works on their mobile device. With this device, we also will be able to manage leads, opportunities, proposals, and projects.\n7. Give your employees input on the CRM:\nIt is important to know from employees what they exactly want from CRM, so this will be easy for the company to provide according to the needs of the employees to make them work better which would lead to the consistency of the employee. It should be noted that the employees should be able to easily access the tool and required training needs to be given to the employees. It is not easy to keep track of company employees who log in every day. Short field designation may create an ideal sense for the sales team, but they may confuse the field rep. So keeping the end user in mind, the CRM needs to be customized.\n8. Make sure your employees are engaged:\nAdopting CRM without employee engagement is of no use. So it is very crucial to know that employees in the sales team understand the importance of CRM and how active they are. It is important to have employees who have good knowledge of the software. Dissatisfied staff will never let the management know their problems which lack in employee engagement. For this, often the company needs to have an employee engagement survey program and check how satisfied employees are, it is crucial to know what business aims to grow and how CRM technology can improve them in a larger scale.\n9. Be social:\n![Be social]\n(https://zibtek.com/blog/content/images/2019/05/16.jpg)\nFor every business that uses CRM as a sales tool, it is important to be social. Keep connected to the tools you already use. This will help the sales rep to know were their leads/contacts often post. For example, Linked In, Facebook, Twitter, Skype, etc. Social media also helps the business in their sales and marketing. It also helps in finding new customers as well to get in touch with those customers who accept or sign an agreement with the company.\nConclusion:\nInitiative and implementation activity in business brings greater opportunity to reach success, and there is much room for improvement. Hence CRM is proven to be an awesome sales strategy that best serves the organization and the customer needs. For this, they need to commit resources in all divisions to meet customer needs. However, in order to achieve business goals, it is important for the organization to focus on the above factors. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

    "extractedText": "SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT\n12 Predictions for The Next Big Thing in Software Development\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n22 APR 2019 • 5 MIN READ\nIn this age of digital transformation, technology is emerging faster than ever before. Business owners must look for strategies and solutions to evolve and make their businesses thrive. In order to stay competitive, they should keep themselves updated and aware of the latest trends in the market. Let’s have a look at our predictions for software development in 2019. By adopting these trends, you can transform your business to a new level.\n1. Containerization- Eases development, testing, and deployment\nMigrating software from the developer’s PC to any other server often turns into a mess. This occurs when there are differences in machine environments, infrastructure, and libraries. Here the containerization technique can be of great help to the developers and testers alike. The way it works is it isolates the software from its environment; and it’s, therefore, able to virtually run anywhere. It lets the software work steadily, despite differences in development and deployment instances.\nContainerization tools like Docker and Kubernetes will gain popularity. They make everything associated with deploying and managing the application easier.\n2. Serverless architecture- Reduces overhead of managing and operating servers\nServerless technology will grow at an astounding rate in the years to come. This rising technology is expected to reach the pinnacle of the cloud ecosystem. Choosing serverless architecture increases the speed of development. It eliminates network management tasks, letting developers build and run applications and services without worrying about servers.\nBenefits of serverless architecture:\nNo need to maintain any server\nApplications can be scaled automatically\nProvides built-in availability and fault-tolerance.\nAWS Lambda is a serverless computing platform that enables the developer to run code for virtually any type of application with no need of a server and administration management. Though it’s not a new phenomenon, the advancement in serverless technology is going to pick up the pace in the coming years. NodeSource recently released NISolid for AWS Lambda. It will optimize the performance, security, and operational efficiency of serverless AWS Lambda functions.\n3. Functional Programming- writing compressed and predictable code\nFunctional programming makes the code easier to follow, test and debug. Developers are adopting this approach for high-level abstraction, that hides a large number of implementation details. This makes the code compact and ensures fewer errors. Unlike the Single Page Application, it’s easy to maintain and debug the code in functional programming.\nWith Elm (programming language) and Facebook ReasonML (toolchain for OCaml), developers are accepting the functional programming solution to bring the language closer to the problem, and not vice-versa.\n4. Build software with software: Create a fully functional app without any coding knowledge\nProgramming languages have become more flexible in syntax, easy to debug and deploy. Several tools are readily available to develop web and mobile applications without having any coding knowledge. They offer customization options and easy GUI to developers. This initiative will help developers to build an app in half the time. This would also bridge the gap between envisioning the software and building it in real life. Building and launching the app will become less daunting and more affordable.\n5. Business Intelligence and Analytics module: Enable better decision making\nEnterprises are growing their businesses by adopting more and more business intelligence (BI) and analytics modules into their products and services. Intelligent data collection and analysis are key aspects to drive more value from the data being generated by the systems. Embedding machine learning with BI and analytics module will become a trend in the future as they will deal with the complexity of data and carry data analysis efficiently.\n6. AI first strategy: Making software smarter than before\nGoogle and Microsoft are already evolving from a ‘mobile-first’ to an ‘AI-first’ world. Other companies are focusing on areas such as- geographical information, image recognition, and natural language processing. Embedding AI and Machine Learning techniques in the process of software development is becoming a key strategy for enterprises. AI-first strategy, from conversational digital assistants to self-driving technologies, are becoming conventional in software development.\n7. Integration of security testing and DevOps: Affordable way to test the reliability of code\nAutomating the server and applications deployment is a key requirement in DevOps. Introducing security testing at the time of development is becoming the goal of DevOps. It is evolving and continuing to change the meaning of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Building the security code at the time of development will provide developers with real-time feedback of the code they are developing. Early security testing will be an affordable approach, as the cost is higher to rectify the code if it is introduced later in the cycle.\n8. Edge computing: Process the data quickly\nBusinesses can benefit by adopting edge computing to increase their operational reliability and security for devices and data. Edge server takes off the load from the server side and processes the data closer to the user. This smaller transmission distance leads to faster response times. It’s of value in situations where we need to examine real-time data from IoT devices. But, in the future, we will see this in non-IoT areas as well, like implementing regulatory compliance locally instead of in a central data server.\n9. Blockchain: Improve the transaction process\nEnterprises are reaping the potential benefits of Blockchain technology. Blockchain collaboration with IoT, AI, and Edge computing are transforming businesses worldwide. Some Blockchain use cases are:\nImproving the government services and ensure trust: Serve citizens’ needs, fight fraud and help meet compliance demands\nPayment and digital currency: Enables 24/7 payment support system, enhanced regulatory compliance, secured networks, and robust access controls\nHealthcare: Allows clinical data to be automatically aggregated, replicated and distributed among researchers and practitioners and provenance tracking and controls.\nBlockchain will be a smart solution for software developers to build processes for revenue management, tracking supply chains, and simplified payment and medical claims processing, etc.\n10. Custom application with API integration: Develop your software in lesser time\nThird party API integration plays a pivotal role in shaping the APIs that developers are using today. With this approach, there will be a huge improvement in the business processes. Unlike custom development, using third-party API is less time consuming for developers. Integration of an already existing solution to match customers’ requirements is less expensive than full-fledged development. In 2019, businesses prefer to work mostly on integration between different services instead of custom software development.\n11. Data-Driven Rating Systems: Intelligent data analysis to improve sales\nWith data-driven rating systems, companies are utilizing their employees’ behavioral data to improve their sales operations. The reliability of online reviews and ratings is heavily impacting businesses today, so they are looking for a platform that has intelligent data analytics techniques to generate objective ratings for their products and services. These systems are going to be crucial in decision-making.\n12. Advanced Graphical tools: Illustrating workflows and products better\nWith the interdependence of the outside world and devices, software platforms are becoming trickier. Businesses require graphics tools to represent the process flows and working of their system. These tools will eradicate the ambiguity related to companies workflows, at the same time enabling the customers to better understand the products and services. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

    "extractedText": "BUSINESS\nHow Long Should Your SaaS Software Trial Period Be?\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n15 APR 2019 • 4 MIN READ\nThe main reason why startups provide a free trial period to their customers is to convert them to pay at the end of the trial. The biggest challenge most companies face is to decide the length of the trial period. Another important question that many people have is, if it is even necessary to have a trial period in the first place. The answer to this question for most software businesses is a resounding ‘yes.’\nSaaS companies should avoid following one-size fits all trial length, as it won’t work for many businesses. Understanding the pros and cons of a long and short trial period is essential to determine which one would fit well for your company.\nIt’s necessary to understand what your direct competitors are doing. In an independent study, results revealed that more than half of the companies have a 30-day trial period while less than one-fifth of the companies have a trial period of two weeks.\nThese are some of the factors that you need to consider when deciding on a trial period:\nThe time it takes for the user to understand your product.\nIs the time sufficient for the user to understand the features of the product and can he or she decide during the trial period that it is the right fit for his or her need?\nHow is the trial length going to affect your sales cycle?\nDuration of time wherein you can financially support a trial period. Be as realistic as possible.\nA Good Trial Period Boosts Your Business\nShort Free Trial Period: You may consider a trial period of two weeks or less as a short free trial period. For some of SaaS companies, it is the ideal time for users to decide whether or not they should buy the product. But some people think that the period is too short for the users to make a decision. Listed below are few of the benefits that a business can enjoy from having a short trial period.\nThe Sense of Urgency: Those who advocate using a shorter trial period believe that the users will be more anxious to use a product when there is very less time at their disposal. If you want the users to convert to become paying customers quickly, it is necessary to have them engaged in the product soon. The users who are more actively using the product in the first three days of a product is more likely to become your paying customer.\nIncrease Sales Per Salesperson: When you have a shorter sales period, the salesperson will have fewer prospects that they need to manage and can, therefore, be more attentive.\nReduce Sales Lifecycle And the Associated Costs: When there is a shorter free trial period, it also means that you are supporting it for a shorter period financially. Now, it will significantly reduce customer acquisition costs (CAC). If your business is growing, the impact of CAC will also increase drastically, and reducing CAC is an important consideration.\nKashflow changed their trial period from 60 days to just two weeks. As a result, they saw an almost 25% increase in customer conversions, which is excellent. Most of the users do not prioritize the product when you give them too many days to decide. When the trial period is limited, they make it top priority to check the product the moment they register for it.\nExtend It If Necessary: If you are one who is concerned that the shorter trial period may not work well for you, you may consider extending it for few people that have a genuine interest in your product. You may choose to do this by sending in a personalized email. When you do this you will be surprised at the number of responses from people who are interested in extending the trial period.\nLong Free Trial Period\nA trial period that is longer than two weeks is considered a long trial period. Of course, longer trial periods are expensive for the company. But it might be the best option when the products that you are selling are complex and require more time for the customers to understand.\nThere is also a concern for many of the companies that extending the trial period may allow the users to delay their decision of using the product. Here are some excellent reasons why you may want to opt for a long free trial period:\nUsers Learn to Use the Product: If you developed a complex product, giving a longer trial period to the user will be beneficial. They will effectively learn how to use the product if they utilize the full trial period.\nLess Pressure: If you are targeting customers who are busy professionals, it is wise to provide them ample time to decide. They will not be pressured to buy something from you as a result.\nProduct Becomes Sticky: This is one of the main reasons why you may consider this option. Users love to pay for applications that are indispensable and those that become an integral part of their life. If someone has spent two months learning and integrating a product, they are much more likely to recognize it as beneficial and worth purchasing. Constant Contact is using this strategy to convert more trial users into paying customers.\nIn Conclusion:\nThese are the pros that you and your company can enjoy choosing a shorter trial period or a longer one. Talk with your team to pick one that is a good fit for your requirement and your product. It is also a good idea to combine both of the options at times depending on the product that you are planning to sell. Another way to see which option will work well for you is conducting an A/B testing with both a long and short trial period. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

    "extractedText": "AGILE DEVELOPMENT\nHow To Be A Great Agile Product Owner\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n18 APR 2018 • 3 MIN READ\nAn Agile product owner’s four main goals are to maintain flexibility with the scope of the project, to receive team feedback or input, to always focus on continuous improvement, and finally to deliver the highest quality products. I’m Jared Cambra, one of Zibtek’s product owners. I am a California native who enjoys spending time with my family and beard growing competitions. Just kidding, but I do have a great beard. I am absolutely fanatical about technology and I love working with people too, which makes being a product owner a great job for me. I have long standing experience in customer success and Zibtek is no different. Not only do I get to work with my clients to create a killer products, I also get to work with Zibtek’s development team. I’ve learned so much from them about how to help my clients and they are always supportive of new features. The Agile methodology works great for us as a distributed development team because our priorities are always shifting. We do everything we can to make sure that we’re building the ideal product for our client. But enough about me, here is my spiel about why Agile project management is the only way to go for your next development project.\nThe Product Owner, Your New Best Friend\nThe idea of Agile project management was founded on 12 basic principles and four core values called the Agile Manifesto. These principles outline the fundamentals of what Agile software development is as we know it. Why the shift from the Waterfall method to the Agile method? Because designing and developing new products with bookended constraints doesn’t render great products. As focuses, timelines, and budgets change throughout the development process, the team can be flexible while maintaining high quality code and producing working deliverables at every stage of development. The bottom line is that most projects are a great fit for Agile development, which can save time and money. So basically, you can’t afford not to give the Agile methodology a try.\nFor an archer, a moving target is a nightmare, for a good product owner, a moving target is part of the daily grind. We develop using Agile because we think it creates the highest quality products with all the right features that our clients deserve. This methodology allows us to meet key milestones and give stakeholders quick and accurate status updates at the drop of a hat. It’s all about embracing change, even if it’s a complete departure from the direction we’ve been going, to develop features that will create value for our clients.\nYour Agile Team\nManaging an Agile software development project can’t be done by just one person. It takes the effort of several team members to develop a truly Agile product. While I’d love to say that all my projects go off without a hitch because I am an incredible product owner, it takes the work of a team to develop greatness. Here’s a quick rundown on who your team is and what their responsibilities are. The Development Team is obvious, they are the ones who will be writing code, testing and developing your product. The Scrum Master owns the responsibility of supporting the development team in any way they need. This person clears roadblocks, manages feature timelines, and buys the team donuts. Finally, the Product Owner holds the responsibility of connecting the client’s wishes with the development team’s tasks. A serious undertaking, no doubt. Zibtek’s product owners (and probably most companies developing using Agile) are required to manage development timelines while always accounting for the project’s scope, communicating development tasks and due dates to the developers, and most importantly turning the client’s ideal product into a workable reality for his team. All the while, this person is adapting to ever-changing priorities and requirements. This role is ultimately responsible for the client’s ROI on development efforts. No pressure.\nWhether you like our model specifically or prefer to use in-house employees, this is the basis for what Agile project management should look like. The product owner plays an important role in getting the client exactly what they want, but the product’s development takes the work of the whole team. Check out some of our past work to get a taste of what we’ve built for all types of clients in several different industries.\nWant a Killer Ebook?\nAgile methods can work for all types of software development models.

    "extractedText": "Save Time and Cut Costs Using QA Automation\nVedant Vyas\nRead more posts by this author.\nVEDANT VYAS\n12 SEP 2023 • 7 MIN READ\nImagine you’re a chef in a busy restaurant. You have to prepare dozens of dishes every night, following different recipes, using different ingredients, and meeting different customer preferences. You have to make sure every dish is cooked to perfection, tastes delicious, and looks appetizing. You also have to avoid any mistakes, such as burning, undercooking, overseasoning, or mixing up orders. How do you manage all these tasks without losing your mind?\nOne possible solution is to use automation. Automation is the process of using machines or software to perform tasks that would otherwise require human intervention. Automation can help you streamline your workflow, save time, and reduce costs. For example, you could use a food processor to chop vegetables, a timer to alert you when the food is ready, or a digital menu to display the orders and track the inventory. Automation can also help you avoid human errors, such as forgetting an ingredient, misreading a recipe, or dropping a plate.\nNow imagine you are a software developer in a busy company. You have to create dozens of applications every month, following different specifications, using different technologies, and meeting different user requirements. You have to make sure every application is functional, reliable, and secure. You also have to avoid any bugs, such as crashes, glitches, vulnerabilities, or inconsistencies. How do you manage all these tasks without losing your mind?\nOne possible solution is to use QA automation. QA automation is the process of using tools or scripts to perform testing tasks that would otherwise require human intervention. QA automation can help you streamline your development process, save time, and cut costs. For example, you could use a testing framework to run unit tests, integration tests, or regression tests automatically; a code analysis tool to check the quality and performance of your code; or a bug tracking system to report and fix any issues. QA automation can also help you avoid human errors, such as missing a test case, overlooking a bug, or breaking a feature.\nIn this blog post, we will explore how QA automation can benefit your software development projects and how you can implement it effectively. We will also discuss some potential drawbacks and challenges of QA automation and how you can overcome them. Finally, we will introduce Zibtek’s QA automation services and how we can help you achieve your goals.\nSave Time and Cut Costs Using QA Automation\nWhat is QA Automation and what are its benefits?\nQA automation is the practice of using software tools or scripts to automate some or all aspects of software testing. Software testing is the process of verifying that a software product meets the specified requirements and expectations. Software testing can be divided into two main types: manual testing and automated testing.\nManual testing is when a human tester performs the testing tasks manually, such as clicking buttons, entering inputs, checking outputs, or comparing results. Manual testing is useful for exploratory testing, usability testing, or user acceptance testing.\nAutomated testing is when a machine performs the testing tasks automatically, such as executing test cases, generating test data, validating test results, or reporting test outcomes. Automated testing is useful for functional testing, performance testing, security testing, or compatibility testing.\nQA automation has many benefits for software development projects:\nIt increases the speed and efficiency of testing by reducing the time and effort required for manual testing.\nIt improves the quality and reliability of software products by detecting and preventing bugs early in the development cycle.\nIt enhances the coverage and accuracy of testing by eliminating human errors and biases.\nIt supports the scalability and maintainability of software products by enabling continuous testing and integration.\nIt facilitates the collaboration and communication among developers, testers, and stakeholders by providing clear and consistent feedback.\nTo achieve QA automation, various tools and techniques are used to create and execute automated test scripts. Some of the popular QA automation tools are:\nNew Relic: A platform that provides real-time performance insights for effective software testing automation.\n- Autify: An AI-powered tool that automates desktop and mobile testing.\n- TestRail: A tool that manages enterprise test management.\n- BugBug: A tool that simplifies web app testing.\n- Avo Assure: A tool that enables 100% no-code test automation.\nSome of the best practices for QA automation are:\n- Choose the right tool for your project based on your needs, budget, and skills.\n- Define clear and measurable goals and metrics for your automation process.\n- Design reusable and maintainable test scripts that follow coding standards and conventions.\n- Use a version control system to manage your test scripts and data.\n- Implement a test automation framework that supports modularity, reusability, and reporting.\n- Run your automated tests regularly and monitor the results.\n- Review and update your test scripts as the software evolves.\nQA automation is a powerful technique that can enhance your software testing process and deliver high-quality products faster. However, it also has some limitations, such as:\n- It cannot replace human judgment and intuition for some types of testing, such as UX or UI testing.\n- It requires initial investment in terms of time, money, and resources to set up and maintain.\n- It may encounter challenges with dynamic or complex software features or environments.\n- It may introduce new errors or bugs if the test scripts are not well-written or updated.\nTherefore, QA automation should be used as a complement to manual testing, not a substitute. A balanced approach that combines both manual and automated testing can ensure optimal results for your software quality assurance.\nReferences:\n: The 30 Best QA Automation Tools For Software Testing In 2023 - The QA Lead\nhttps://theqalead.com/tools/qa-automation-tools/\n: QA Automation: A Complete Guide (August 2023) | TestGrid\nhttps://www.testgrid.io/blog/qa-automation-guide/\n: What is QA Automation: Benefits, Limitations, Tools, and Best Practices ...\nhttps://www.browserstack.com/guide/what-is-qa-automation\nHow does QA automation save time?\nQA automation can save time in various ways:\nIt reduces the need for repetitive and tedious manual testing tasks that can slow down the development process.\nIt enables parallel and concurrent testing that can run multiple tests simultaneously on different devices or platforms.\nIt allows faster feedback loops that can provide immediate results and insights for developers to fix issues or improve features.\nIt supports test-driven development (TDD) that can help developers write better code by following the test-first approach.\nIt enables continuous delivery (CD) that can help developers deploy software products faster and more frequently by automating the deployment pipeline.\nHow does QA automation cut costs?\nQA automation can cut costs in various ways:\nIt lowers the labor costs by reducing the need for hiring or training manual testers.\nIt reduces the maintenance costs by minimizing the dependency on manual test scripts that can become outdated or irrelevant over time.\nIt decreases the defect costs by preventing bugs from reaching production or affecting users.\nIt increases the return on investment (ROI) by delivering software products that meet or exceed customer expectations and satisfaction.\nWhat are some potential drawbacks to QA automation?\nQA automation is not a silver bullet that can solve all software testing challenges. QA automation also has some potential drawbacks that need to be considered:\nIt requires upfront investment in terms of time, money, and resources to select, implement, and maintain the automation tools and scripts.\nIt may not be suitable for all types of testing, such as exploratory testing, usability testing, or user acceptance testing that require human judgment and interaction.\nIt may introduce new risks or challenges, such as technical issues, compatibility issues, or security issues that can affect the automation process or results.\nIt may create a false sense of confidence or complacency that can lead to over-reliance on automation or underestimation of manual testing.\nSave Time and Cut Costs Using QA Automation\nWhat do I need to know before I start QA automation?\nQA automation is not a one-size-fits-all solution that can be applied to any software development project. QA automation requires careful planning and preparation to ensure its success and effectiveness. Here are some things you need to know before you start QA automation:\nYour goals and objectives: What are you trying to achieve with QA automation? What are the expected outcomes and benefits? How will you measure and evaluate the results?\nYour scope and strategy: What are the types and levels of testing that you want to automate? What are the criteria and priorities for selecting the test cases?

    "extractedText": "PHP\nScale from Within or Hire a PHP Web Development Company?\nVedant Vyas\nRead more posts by this author.\nVEDANT VYAS\n12 JUN 2023 • 6 MIN READ\nImagine you’ve just launched your eCommerce business or mind-blowing media app. Your company’s website’s gaining traction and seeing some crazy-good conversions and customer engagement. It’s exciting and satisfying to watch your online presence surge with success.\nAnd then Debbie Downer crashes your party. Her buzzkill warnings about the potential challenges that lie ahead are suddenly turning your joy into overwhelming despair. How are you going to handle the traffic? What will you do when your current website infrastructure and capabilities hit a wall and aren’t enough to sustain demand? Can you afford to hire a lot more people to take your website to its next level of performance, scalability, and user experience?\nYou start fantasizing about booting Debbie out of the room so you can get back to your celebration. You settle for politely and gracefully escorting her out of the room. But her questions still hang in the air.\nHere’s the good news. While Ms. Downer’s concerns might come across as discouraging, you have the power to see every challenge as an opportunity for growth and improvement.\nBut what if your small tech team doesn’t have the experience or appropriate skills to get you to the next level?\nWith the right PHP web development company by your side, you can tackle any development obstacle head-on and turn it into an advantage. You can leverage the company’s experience and expertise to unlock your website’s full potential, implementing features and apps that elevate your business’s online presence to new heights.\nWhat is PHP Used For in Web Development?\nPHP, or Hypertext Preprocessor, is a popular server-side scripting language web developers use for dynamic and static applications to create more engaging online experiences for customers and staff. Engineers often use it to build responsive websites that perform various server-side tasks, interacting with databases, handling forms, and processing user input.\nKey uses of PHP in web development include:\nServer-side scripting that seamlessly integrates with HTML.\nDatabase system integration, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and more.\nPowering numerous content management systems like WordPress, Drupal, Magento, and Joomla.\nDeveloping eCommerce websites and online stores.\nBuilding complex web applications with efficiency and maintainability.\nCreating RESTful APIs and web services for external applications and services.\nPHP’s longevity—it debuted in 1994—has led to a vast ecosystem of frameworks, libraries, and other resources that make web development with PHP efficient and powerful.\nOf course, no one language is ideal in every situation. For instance, you wouldn’t want to use PHP for enterprise-grade web applications or when your project has critical security considerations.\nScale from Within or Hire a PHP Web Development Company?\nCan My Team Handle a PHP Web Development Project?\nSmaller in-house development teams sometimes encounter limitations when creating dynamic web applications and pages, including:\n1. A shortage of expertise and skillsets, particularly if the team lacks technically diverse talent. Building dynamic web applications is a complex process that requires a range of skills, including front and back-end development, user experience design, and database management. Teams without these skills might struggle to implement advanced features or tackle knotty requirements.\n2. Time and resource constraints, especially if the team has multiple projects they’re working on. They could find it difficult to prioritize tasks and meet deadlines, negatively impacting the development process. Limited access to resources like software, hardware, and specialized tools can also impede a team's ability to create highly optimized and scalable solutions.\n3. Lack of specialized knowledge in dynamic web development such as third-party integrations and implementing complex APIs can lead to more time spent researching and learning rather than developing.\n4. Maintenance and support are ongoing tasks. An in-house team could struggle to allocate the resources and time needed for continuous updates, bug fixes, and security patches.\n5. A constantly evolving landscape makes adapting and incorporating emerging technologies like new frameworks, libraries, and tools challenging, resulting in less scalable or efficient applications.\n6. Without external and objective perspectives, an in-house team may lose track of industry best practices, hindering innovation and leading to solutions that are less user-friendly or less optimized.\nThere are positive aspects to in-house PHP development, including the advantage of familiarity with your business’s goals and processes. However, supplementing in-house capabilities with the external expertise of a PHP web development company can help overcome the above limitations.\nCheck out our short with 3 tips on when you should hire a software company to help your in-house team!\nHow Do I Know if I Should Hire a PHP Web Development Company?\nWhen hearing these limitations, some businesses immediately decide to outsource their PHP web development. Others, though, are still on the fence, and that’s understandable.\nWhen deciding whether to outsource PHP web development, think about things like your project’s complexity, available in-house resources, and your team’s skillset and expertise. And then ask yourself if:\nYou anticipate significant growth or expansion.\nYou have the financial resources to cover the expense of hiring additional staff with the right skills and expertise.\nYour team is equipped to handle the ongoing support and maintenance requirements that ensure your project’s longevity and reliability.\nDiscussing your concerns and questions with one or more PHP development companies can also help you weigh the benefits against the associated costs of hiring an outsource partner.\nShould I Outsource PHP Web Development?\nAs a third-party provider of software, security, and advisory solutions, we’re admittedly biased about the advantages of outsourcing PHP web development. That said, we also know that there are instances when keeping development in-house is preferable and makes more sense. For example, if you have a unique, highly specialized project that requires close collaboration with other internal teams or if you have concerns about data security and confidentiality, in-house development might be best.\nWhether you should outsource PHP web development generally comes down to your specific requirements, budget, timeline, and available resources. When making a decision, it can help to objectively evaluate your in-house team’s expertise and capacity, weigh the costs and benefits of outsourcing, and assess whether outsourcing will better meet your project goals.\nScale from Within or Hire a PHP Web Development Company?\nHow Can Zibtek Help Scale My Development Team?\nTo sum up, outsourcing your PHP web development gives you:\n1. Access to skilled developers.\n2. Flexibility in resource allocation.\n3. Faster project delivery.\n4. Access to industry best practices.\n5. The opportunity to offload some or all development tasks so your team can concentrate on higher-level activities.\n6. Streamlined project management.\n7. Ongoing support and maintenance.\nBecause we’ve perfected the right balance of US engineering expertise and off-shore labor, we’re able to deliver top-notch development services at an incredible rate, offering our clients the absolute pinnacle of value in the software development sphere.\nSo, don't let the Debbie Downers of the world dampen your entrepreneurial spirits.

    "extractedText": "APP DEVELOPMENT\nA Comprehensive Guide to Custom Application Development\nVedant Vyas\nRead more posts by this author.\nVEDANT VYAS\n30 MAY 2023 • 6 MIN READ\nZibtek knows a thing or two about custom application development services, and we’d like to share some of that wisdom with you. But before we do, we’d like to open your mind to an analogy of a frustrating tale about furniture.\nThat’s right, today we’re going sofa shopping!\nAllow us to paint a picture and see if you can empathize with our story.. You drive to your nearest bargain home furnishings store and wade into a mesmerizing menagerie of magnificent sofas. Each has its appeal, but as your search continues, a sad realization sets in—none of them have all the design features and characteristics you desire. One has the power recliners you need to make movie nights more enjoyable, but where are the cup holders? Another has hidden storage compartments for all your gaming gear, but not the USB ports to charge them.\nAnd all at once, it hits you that you require a store that allows you to handpick elements to create a sofa precisely tailored to your preferences and needs. In other words, it’s time to head to the nearest bespoke furniture store to build and customize the sofa of your dreams. Before long, you’re the happy owner of a unique, personalized masterpiece that harmonizes with your space and exceeds anything you could have bought off the big-box floor.\nWhat Is Custom Application Development?\nCustom app development is a lot like buying a tailor-made sofa. Professional software engineers design and develop software applications, custom-made to your project’s unique requirements. They build your dream application from scratch rather than rely on off-the-shelf software solutions.\nMost custom app development projects involve the same several stages:\n1. Requirements gathering\n2. Design\n3. Development\n4. Testing\n5. Deployment\n6. Ongoing maintenance and support\nA custom application is carefully crafted to address your business objectives and the project’s needs, ensuring optimal functionality and efficiency. While custom app development can in some cases involve more time, expertise, and financial resources, it offers advantages off-the-shelf solutions can’t begin to match.\nA Comprehensive Guide to Custom Application Development\nBenefits of Custom Application Development\nSometimes the quickest way to explain the benefits of custom application development is to showcase brands that have used custom apps to revolutionize their industries.\nStarbucks’ highly regarded custom app lets customers quickly locate nearby stores, pay for food and drinks in advance, and earn rewards. It also provides personalized offers and recommendations.\nSpotify is generally considered the best music streaming app, offering a vast library of songs, personalized recommendations, and curated playlists.\nNike’s “Nike Training Club” delivers customized workout plans, tracking features, and training videos. It also includes social integration so people can connect with other workout enthusiasts.\nAs you map out your application’s requirements and objectives, think about your customers’ unique pain points and how the app will give your business a competitive edge. You’ll also want to consider how the application will scale and change as your enterprise grows.\nTypes of Custom App Development\nThere are various types of custom apps, each catering to a business’s special needs and objectives. Some of the most common include:\n1.Mobile apps leverage mobile devices’ unique features and capabilities like touchscreens, location-based services, and connectivity options.\n2. Desktop applications like productivity tools and video editing programs maximize a computer’s full capabilities. They’re often developed to provide users with rich and immersive experiences.\n3. Web-based apps are platform-independent, running on browsers and accessed over the internet. Unlike desktop apps, web-based applications don’t require installation on a user’s device.\n4. Enterprise applications meet the unique requirements of large organizations. They streamline processes, improve internal communication, and encourage collaboration.\n5. Business apps are tailored to meet a company’s specific needs, be it to automate tasks or make informed decisions.\n6. Scientific applications support research, analysis, simulations, and modeling. They’re used by researchers, scientists, and other professionals to analyze data, perform experiments, and gain valuable insights.\n7. Gaming apps provide users with engaging experiences on various platforms, including mobile devices, desktops, and virtual reality systems.\n8. Cloud-based applications are hosted on remote servers and are frequently used for SaaS services, where users don’t have to install and manage the software.\n9. Distributed apps are suitable for a broad range of applications requiring distributed processing and collaboration, such as resource sharing, scalability, and consistency and synchronization.\nWhy Use Custom-Built Apps vs. Off-The-Shelf?\nIf our sofa shopping experience taught us anything, it’s that customization is what makes users happy. Developing an app that offers personalization, higher quality, exclusivity, and sets your brand apart from the competition to create a sense of user ownership and loyalty that store-bought solutions simply don’t.\nOther reasons to invest in custom vs. off-the-shelf include\nPersonalization of products and services instead of catering to a broad and more generic customer base.\nHigher quality products and services with the features and specifications your users need.\nA singularity that gets people excited about using your app. No other app can give users what they’re looking for.\nScalability and flexibility so as your business grows, your app adapts, ensuring it remains relevant and effective.\nIntegration and compatibility with existing systems, databases, and technologies ensure your custom app allows for smooth data exchange, streamlined operations, and real-time updates.\nLong-term cost savings by reducing reliance on additional software and expensive workarounds.\nA Comprehensive Guide to Custom Application Development\nWhat Can We Expect From Custom App Development?\nNo one has yet developed an app that makes you an instant concert pianist, or has you speaking fluent dolphin (though we have no doubt that day is coming). But custom app development is a fantastic tool for businesses who want to build powerful software solutions that cater specifically to their needs and objectives.\nZibtek’s 5-step custom app development process is designed to transform your brilliant vision into a vibrant reality. Here’s how we do it.\nStep 1: Strategy\nWe start by understanding your business goals, requirements, and desired outcomes. Our team collaborates with you to gather information, identify challenges, and offer potential solutions that lay the foundation for a successful app development journey.\nStep 2: Design & Architecture\nOnce research is complete and requirements are clear, we begin the design phase bringing into focus your app’s look, feel, and function. Prototypes are created for your review, and feedback is solicited to determine where changes must be made. We also assess the feasibility of using one development technology over another and help you decide if stability and cost outweigh the “novel and unproven”.\nStep 3: Development\nOur developers now jump into action, coding the app’s functionalities and integrating necessary frameworks and APIs. Quality assurance engineers rigorously test the app to identify and fix any issues.\nStep 4: Launch\nIt’s showtime! Once your custom app’s been thoroughly tested and approved, it's ready for deployment on intended platforms, such as app stores or internal distribution channels.\nStep 5: Maintenance\nOur journey together doesn't end at launch. We accept feedback and help your business stay flexible as it grows. And our team helps your app stay up-to-date, secure, and compatible with evolving technologies.\nHow to Create Custom Apps with Zibtek\nWhen you entrust your custom application development services to us, you get unparalleled technical expertise that exceeds your expectations.

    "extractedText": "PHP Development Company\nVedant Vyas\nRead more posts by this author.\nVEDANT VYAS\n11 MAR 2023 • 6 MIN READ\nDepending on who you talk to:\nPHP sucked yesterday, sucks now, and will still suck tomorrow.\nor\nPHP is a whole lot better than it used to be, and who are we to argue with Facebook, WordPress, Slack, and Tumblr?\nFor the record, we believe the nearly 30-year-old PHP is a great choice for creating top-notch websites and applications. So, while many naysayers have predicted its demise over the decades, our view is PHP is here to stay—and its future as an innovative programming language appears secure.\nThat said, there are definitely times you shouldn’t use a PHP development company, which we’ll talk about further down.\nWhat is a PHP Development Company?\nOriginally an acronym for Personal Homepage, PHP now stands for Hypertext Preprocessor. Today, you can find it on millions of websites, making it one of the most in-demand server-side scripting languages developers use.\nLike its closest competitor, Python, PHP is an interpreted, object-oriented programming language that can run on practically any underlying operating system. Among the first server-side languages that could be embedded into HTML, developers appreciate how easy PHP makes it to add web page functionality without having to call external files for data.\nPHP Development Company\nThe Great PHP Debate: Yay or Nay?\nDo a little Googling, and you’ll find plenty of people arguing that PHP is dying or dead. And they have plenty of reasons to support their POV:\nJavaScript (Node.js), Python, and other languages are superior in every way.\nPHP unnecessarily complicates the development process.\nThe only reason major players still use PHP is that it was at its peak when their sites and apps were built.\nNew-generation programmers aren’t picking PHP as a language to master.\nPHP is insecure and exploits are readily found in its code.\nAnd on and on it goes.\nBut here’s the thing. Personal opinions aside, the statistics show PHP is still a relevant language. It’s used by nearly 80% of all websites that use a server-side language, and over 60% of WordPress sites utilize it. Plus:\nPHP Development Company\nIt’s been around for a long time, which makes it easy to find PHP developers with years, if not decades, of experience.\nIt’s open source. Who doesn’t love free, right? Anyone can download PHP to develop and build a website without having to pay to use it. And many popular PHP frameworks like Symfony and Laravel are built on top of PHP and also free to use.\nIt’s highly supported. The hyper-collaborative PHP community has developed thousands of plugins and modules that provide distinct functionality and features.\nIt’s versatile and quick. Developers can use PHP to create any type of website and solve just about any sort of problem. And because its libraries manage common tasks, there’s less code to write and less reinventing the wheel.\nIt’s easy to learn. Developers love languages they can quickly master and that are well-documented. There are literally thousands of blogs, tutorials, books, and online courses on PHP, most of them freely available.\nThe bottom line? Wanting PHP to be dead and PHP actually being dead are two very, very, different things. The truth is PHP’s longevity is one of its greatest strengths. From its launch in 1994 as PHP version 1.0 to its latest release of PHP 8.2 in November 2022, the language has seen continuous improvement in its performance and stability.\nWhen Not to Use PHP Development\nIn keeping with our well-earned reputation as an unbiased software development company, we’re happy to share a few reasons for not using PHP for your project.\nIt can be debatable for enterprise-grade web applications considering what some of the newer frameworks offer in terms of security and performance. If your app requires more features like queue-based, asynchronous, multi-threaded processing then, Node.js, Python, .NET, Golang, and JavaScript stacks offer advanced libraries to engage with.\nThe primary issue is that developers today prefer to write less custom code and lean on the tested frameworks to accomplish tasks. Because PHP is an older language, developers can write a lot of code to make some functions work. For instance, if we need to use message queues such as RabbitMQ, we would spend quite a bit more time making the PHP code bulletproof compared to Node.js.\nIn some cases, PHP can take a lot of time to code, which will increase the estimated time when compared to Nest JS, Java spring boot, Express JS, or other frameworks. These come with a larger library of built-in widgets and packages that require less coding from developers.\nPHP also lacks some of the newer tools for debugging which are crucial to identify errors and warnings.\nPHP traditionally is used with relational databases such as MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. While you can use NoSQL databases with PHP, these options aren’t as popular, so the support and packages aren’t available which is more time-consuming.\nHiring a PHP Development Company vs. Freelance vs. In-house\nThe second biggest debate about PHP is whether a dedicated PHP development company or a freelancer can offer better PHP development services. Like most things software-related, you’ll need to consider multiple factors when deciding between the two. But here’s why we think working with a PHP development company instead of a freelancer is just about always a good idea.\nExpertise. A PHP development company typically has in-house web designers, developers, and an SEO team that can provide you with a full range of services. Most freelancers do not.\nVersatility. Most established PHP development companies have worked for multiple clients with different requirements. You might have to search far and wide for a freelancer who has worked on a project similar to yours.\nReliable support. A development company with years of PHP experience offers support services, including post-launch. The last thing you want is a freelancer not taking your calls when a problem arises.\nTransparency in services. Freelancers don’t always offer the same level of workflow structure or communication as a development company does. For instance, you’re much more likely to get real-time updates and timely solutions with a development company than you are with a freelancer who lacks an internal support staff.\nOf course, you could hire an in-house PHP developer, an option that comes with undeniable benefits—like they know your company inside and out and sit next to you as your project’s developed. For many businesses, though, this is a non-starter, as the associated costs of finding, onboarding, and paying a salary and benefits to a full-time engineer are prohibitive. By hiring per project, you can reduce costs and engage developers only when there’s a need.\nAll that said, if working with a freelancer instead of a PHP development company is what works for you, we support it 100 percent!\nPHP Development Company\nThe Future Looks Bright for PHP\nDevelopers who insist PHP is a stodgy relic of the past may never be persuaded otherwise. But with concerns about performance, security, and scalability addressed with each new release of PHP, it’s hard to see the programming language falling out of development teams’ tech stacks anytime soon.\nUltimately, the language you choose for your project depends on what you’re trying to build and what features you want to prioritize. It can be a complicated decision. But if you’re looking to build a dynamic website or application within a certain budget, PHP is still relevant and useful for front and back-end development. Whatever programming language you decide on, Zibtek’s network of developers have skills in all stacks, ensuring your project comes through on-time, on-budget, and with all bases covered. We would love to learn more about the product you are building. Schedule a meeting with us today to connect. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

    "extractedText": "Xamarin vs React Native: How To Choose The Best Framework For Cross-Platform App Development\nVedant Vyas\nRead more posts by this author.\nVEDANT VYAS\n3 FEB 2022 • 5 MIN READ\nXamarin vs React Native are two competing frameworks for cross-platform app development. They are both free, open-source platforms that each offer their own significant advantages, and each has its associated pros and cons. In this post, we’ll take a look at how they compare when it comes to performance, popularity, and support and offer an overview of each framework’s pros and cons.\nXamarin vs React Native - What is Cross-Platform App Development?\nThe 276 million people who use smartphones in the U.S. spend 80% of their time on them using mobile applications. Cross-platform development allows engineers to build mobile apps that can run on multiple platforms, saving companies money and reducing development time.\nThe massive shift from desktop to mobile traffic means companies must develop apps focused on user accessibility and convenience. Those that do create apps that function across multiple platforms find themselves richly rewarded, with equally happy Android and iOS users.\nWhether you call it unifying, streamlining, or dismantling silos, the point of cross-platform apps is an end-user expectation companies would be wise to respond to. Today, most organizations understand this concept but remain unsure about which approach will help them best deliver what their customers want. Put another way, they don’t question whether they need to build mobile apps, but rather how. This is why we compare Xamarin vs React Native. Deciding on which one to build an app around will fundamentally shape the way the project goes.\nReact Native in Cross-Platform APP Development\nReact Native is a cross-platform mobile app development framework developers can use to build mobile applications for iOS and Android devices with one tech stack. Developed in 2015, the framework enables engineers to leverage JavaScript and React libraries to build mobile applications using native UI components that provide a higher-quality user interface.\nReact Native’s elements allow for faster development time and offer a vast library of UI components, including:\nA JavaScript framework that supports cross-platform development of all JavaScript features.\nA lightweight JavaScript programming language that allows developers to create interactive pages.\nIDE tools like Atom, Visual Studio Code, and Nuclide.\nWhat is Xamarin?\nLike React Native, Xamarin is a cross-platform app development tool developers use to produce native Android, iOS, and Windows apps with unified and branded UXs. First launched in 2011, the popular framework employs the Mono framework to communicate with the Application Program Interface (API) of common mobile device functions. Many developers like Xamarin because it’s an easy transition that allows them to build robust applications using the C# programming language that runs on the .NET Common Language Infrastructure.\nXamarin’s elements minimize development and allow users to navigate across multiple channels.\nThe Mono .NET framework supports cross-platform development of all .NET framework features and also delivers a more extensive toolkit for Linux developers.\nIts C# language includes features like LINQ, Generics, and Parallel Task Library which streamline the transition between platforms.\nIDE tools like Visual Studio and XCode are the most frequently used complements to the Xamarin platform.\nXamarin vs React Native\nIts generally accepted by the mobile app development community that React Native and Xamarin are the two go-to frameworks when creating mobile apps. But when it comes to choosing between the two, there’s one vital question developers need to consider: do they prefer using JavaScript or C#?\nThose who prefer JavaScript are probably better off using React Native.\nIf C# is the preferred programming language, Xamarin is typically the better choice.\nBecause both frameworks are viable options for cross-platform app development, it’s helpful to weigh each approach’s advantages and disadvantages in a side-by-side manner.\nAvailability and Cost\nReact Native is extremely flexible, allows developers to choose their preferred IDE, and is entirely free, including all of its libraries.\nXamarin does offer a free version, though it doesn’t have quite as many resources as React Native and using the Visual Studio requires a fee.\nTechnologies\nReact Native uses JavaScript, one of the most popular and commonly used programming languages.\nXamarin uses the C# programming language and the .NET framework. It also comes with plenty of support from Microsoft and provides developers with a robust set of tools, including native platform integration, debuggers, and a rich editor.\nDevelopment Environment\nReact Native’s Live Reload feature lets developers see in real-time the effects of any code changes, offering a considerable advantage, particularly in terms of time management. The framework’s Hot Reload feature allows the app to keep running even if developers inject new file versions.\nXamarin has what many developers consider a much friendlier development environment, as it enables them to write code that’s specifically designed for iPhone apps on Windows and compile it for Mac. The framework also uses Visual Studio or XCode IDEs to develop Mac apps, both of which are substantially easier to use than React Native.\nCommunity Support\nA recent StackOverflow survey found React Native ranks as the sixth most popular development framework on the market and third for the most wanted framework.\nXamarin was voted tenth most popular and eleventh in the most wanted category.\nGeneral Consensus\nThe StackOverflow survey did a good comparison between Xamarin vs React Native. It claims that React Native is a more popular choice than Xamarin, but it must be noted that which framework developers choose often comes down to a question of allegiance. So, while there’s plenty of debate over which framework outperforms the other, it still comes down to whether developers prefer C# or JavaScript.\nThe bottom line is both frameworks are open-source and support cross-platform development, helping accelerate time to market for brands that want to bridge multiple consumer channels. In the software development sphere, it’s fair to say that Xamarin is seen as the wise and cultured grandfather while React Native is the high-energy and dogged young guy with loads of charisma. Conventional wisdom, then, says:\nXamarin is reliable, but React Native is agile.\nSmall-scale projects benefit from React Native’s insanely intelligent code, but enterprise-level solutions might want to choose Xamarin because of its long-established reputation.\nApps intended for multiple platform release can be done more quickly if they use Xamarin, but those that aren’t as inherently complex can benefit from native development.\nIn the end, the best way to know which framework is the right one for your cross-platform app development is to consult with a professional software development specialist who can help you make the right decision based on things like intended use, functionality, and audience.

    "extractedText": "Software Implementation Plan: Here are 5 Hallmarks of a Successful One\nVedant Vyas\nRead more posts by this author.\nVEDANT VYAS\n23 DEC 2021 • 4 MIN READ\nWhat is a software implementation plan, and why do you need one? The answer’s simple: a software implementation plan helps you find and deploy the right software for your business’s needs. It makes sure you collaborate with the correct people and lets you avoid making hasty decisions. Most of all, it ensures end users get a solution they truly need.\nIf you want to avoid hitches and complications in your software implementation process, follow these guidelines.\n5 Phases of an Effective Software Implementation Plan\nToday, small businesses have incredible opportunities to compete against the big guys. The right tools and software can:\nHelp employees improve processes\nOptimize workflows\nIncrease productivity\nImprove the customer experience\nAdopting new software is a time-consuming and not inexpensive process. Without a pre-implementation plan in place, the odds increase your software adoption will fail. We want to help prevent that from happening. Here’s what we recommend.\n1. Develop a Roadmap\nSome people define it as building your business case. Others call it like it is—justifying a proposed project based on its benefits. Whatever you call it, the goal is to avoid costly mistakes that could hurt your business financially and reputationally.\nThings to consider include:\nDefining your pain points. What challenges are you facing? What needs improvement? Talk to relevant stakeholders and staff to get the answers and align your business objectives with your goals.\nDetermining a solution. Are you looking to improve employee productivity and efficiency? Create a detailed outline of how your new software will accomplish those goals.\nConducting a cost and benefit analysis. Building a solid business case helps you justify your investment. It’s essential to analyze both tangible and intangible costs you’ll incur and gains you stand to achieve.\nDevelop a timeline. Set realistic time expectations for how long it will take to evaluate the software, implement it, and realize a return.\nPlan how you’ll manage change. Most organizational transformations fail. A big reason for this is the lack of buy-in from leaders and staff. You’ll need to make your case and prove how you’ll steer clear of the mistakes other organizations have made.\n2. Plan, Plan, and Plan Some More\nIf you thought planning was an important part of a software implementation plan, you were right. The more detailed you get at this stage, the greater your chances of success. Interviews with end-users, creative sessions with engineers and owners, and available data analysis all help you filter out extraneous or unrealistic ideas and keep you focused on the big picture. Now’s the time to identify which processes and teams will be affected by the software implementation. You’ll want to consider every possible process the new software might affect:\nHow long will the implementation last?\nWill it be done in stages or all at once?\nWill it require new security measures?\nWho’s going to train the end-users?\n3. Process and Solution Designs\nWhen implementing new software, you typically need to adjust various processes to the logic used to build the software. Hiring a software development company ensures the appropriate process design methods are used.\nA solution design is essentially a business process roadmap where you map the new software to your business requirements, so everything works in tandem. Along the way—sometimes even months after the software’s launched—you may realize other methods work better. Solution design identifies which features of your new software can be used just as they are and which aspects will need to be customized to fit your needs and goals.\n4. Customization\nBusinesses customize software to meet specific business environments, processes, and needs. Software customization varies greatly depending on each requirement. It can be as simple as adding new fields or as complex as building new automation or modules. You should only customize processes that make sense for your specific business needs. There’s no advantage in customizing for its own sake.\n5. Training and Testing\nThey come last, but training and testing are certainly not the least critical phases. Training differs from user to user, but the end goal is the same: you don’t want software no one wants to use. To avoid having to force people to use new software:\nPrepare them for the implementation as early as you can. The sooner people know a change is coming, the more accepting of it they’ll likely be.\nAssign a change manager who gives users answers to their questions, additional training, feedback, and other information.\nMake sure everyone understands the tremendous benefits the software offers.\nAs preliminary testing and feedback reveal shortcomings in the software, the development team will need to make incremental changes or even roll back to earlier versions. Like training, testing’s an ongoing process that needs to be done throughout the software implementation process, including after the team’s been using the software for a while.\nImplementations can be stressful, but working with the on-demand development team at Zibtek makes the process a whole lot more enjoyable.

But what exactly is the difference between these two models, and how do you choose the right one for your project?\nTo help you make an informed decision, we'll compare staff augmentation and outsourcing software development using a creative analogy: building a house. We'll also show you how Zibtek can help you with either option and introduce you to our unique On Demand Workforce+ model that combines the best of both worlds.\nSo, what exactly is the difference?\nStaff augmentation is like hiring temporary workers to help you build your house. You still have full control over the design, materials, and timeline of the project, but you don't have to worry about recruiting, training, or managing the extra workers. You can hire them for as long as you need them, and let them go when the project is done.\nOutsourcing software development is like hiring a contractor to build your house for you. You give them your requirements, budget, and deadline, and they take care of everything else. You don't have to deal with the details of the construction process, but you also have less visibility and control over the outcome.\nWhen should you choose staff augmentation?\nStaff augmentation is a good option if you:\n- Have an existing software development team that needs extra support or expertise\n- Want to maintain full control and ownership over your project\n- Have a clear vision and scope for your project\n- Have a flexible timeline and budget\n- Want to avoid the hassle of hiring and managing permanent employees\nSome of the benefits of staff augmentation are:\n- You can access a large pool of qualified and experienced developers from around the world\n- You can scale up or down your team as needed, depending on your project's demands\n- You can save costs on recruitment, training, payroll, taxes, and benefits\n- You can improve your team's productivity and efficiency by adding specialized skills or fresh perspectives\nSome of the challenges of staff augmentation are:\n- You still have to manage the communication and collaboration between your in-house and augmented teams\n- You still have to provide the tools, infrastructure, and security for your augmented team\n- You still have to deal with potential cultural or language barriers between your in-house and augmented teams\n- You still have to ensure the quality and consistency of your project's deliverables\nWhen should you choose outsourcing software development?\nOutsourcing software development is a good option if you:\n- Don't have an existing software development team or lack the necessary skills or resources\n- Want to focus on your core business activities and leave the technical details to the experts\n- Have a well-defined and fixed scope for your project\n- Have a tight timeline and budget\n- Want to reduce the risks and liabilities associated with software development\nSome of the benefits of outsourcing software development are:\n- You can leverage the expertise and experience of a professional software development company\n- You can get a high-quality product delivered on time and within budget\n- You can save costs on hiring, training, managing, and retaining employees\n- You can free up your time and resources to focus on other aspects of your business\nSome of the challenges of outsourcing software development are:\n- You have less control and visibility over your project's progress and quality\n- You have to trust that the outsourcing company will deliver on their promises and meet your expectations\n- You have to deal with potential communication or coordination issues due to different time zones or work styles\n- You have to ensure that your intellectual property rights and data security are protected\nOutsourcing software development with Zibtek: What to expect\nIf you decide to outsource your software development project to Zibtek, here's what you can expect from us:\n- A dedicated project manager who will be your single point of contact throughout the project\n- A team of experienced developers who will work on your project using agile methodologies and best practices\n- A transparent and collaborative process that will keep you updated and involved at every stage of the project\n- A flexible and scalable approach that will adapt to your changing needs and feedback\n- A quality assurance process that will ensure that your product meets your requirements and standards\n- A post-launch support service that will provide ongoing maintenance and updates for your product\nAccording to Statista, 59% of businesses outsource their software development projects because they want to reduce costs. However, cost is not the only factor that matters when it comes to outsourcing. At Zibtek, we understand that quality, reliability, communication, and customer satisfaction are equally important. That's why we strive to deliver not only cost-effective but also high-quality software solutions that meet your needs and exceed your expectations.\nAnother option: On Demand Workforce+ With Zibtek\nIf you're not sure whether staff augmentation or outsourcing software development is right for you, or if you want to enjoy the benefits of both models, we have another option for you: “On Demand Workforce+” With Zibtek.\nOn Demand Workforce+ With Zibtek is a hybrid model that combines the flexibility and control of staff augmentation with the expertise and efficiency of outsourcing software development. With On Demand Workforce+ With Zibtek, you can:\n- Hire one or more developers from our pool of talented and vetted professionals\n- Assign them to work on your project as part of your in-house or augmented team\n- Manage them directly or let us manage them for you\nOn Demand Workforce+ With Zibtek is ideal for businesses that want to:\n- Fill the skill gaps in their existing software development team\n- Scale up their team quickly and easily\n- Access a wide range of skills and technologies from our diverse and global talent pool\n- Save costs on recruitment, training, payroll, taxes, and benefits\nWhether you choose staff augmentation, outsourcing software development, or On Demand Workforce+ With Zibtek, we're here to help you with your software development needs.

It’s open source IMathAS platform enabled online math assessment and course management for a large and growing number of users. Schools, instructors, and students all liked the ease of use and the accuracy of results provided by the OpenMath solution.\nChallenge\nAs OpenMath was growing and continuing to use its original platform, problems arose. The original platform was outdated, built on Plain Old PHP without an established environment/framework. Implementing this platform was time consuming for onboarding learning institutions. What was once a benefit of customizability and compatibility was becoming a pitfall. In an age where everyone wants a ready-to-go software package, OpenMath’s implementation was difficult for new users. There were also some significant security concerns, and the platform as a whole wasn’t built to scale despite the clear market demand. OpenMath needed help to give IMathAS the full-package makeover it needed, and Zibtek was there to lend a hand.\nGoals\nOpenMath knew it needed to upgrade its product if it was going to continue growing its user base. Making the platform easier to implement and providing its users with an even better experience were the main goals.\nSolution\nWhat Zibtek built for OpenMath was a responsive and robust framework around the existing IMathAS platform making it far easier for learning institutions to implement and front-end users to utilize. The PHP framework Yii 2 was used for the backbone of the upgraded platform’s functionality, with a surrounding environment built on MySQL, Bootstrap, and HTML5—fully compliant, fully responsive, easy to implement on the institution-side and completely compatible with any web-enabled device. Zibtek added a complete messaging system to allow on-platform communication between students and instructors- a game changer. We also added grade book functionality, a forum for open discussions, language and cultural adaption support, and fixed the previously mentioned security concerns.\nOutcome\nAs you may know, we love working with Ed Tech companies and this one is no different! We are honored to partner with OpenMath to create a more robust and useful tool for so many in the education market. With easier implementation and some new functionality, instructors can spend more time teaching and students spend more time learning.

    "extractedText": "Why Software Developers Love These Java Frameworks\nVedant Vyas\nRead more posts by this author.\nVEDANT VYAS\n1 SEP 2022 • 5 MIN READ\nJava has long been considered one of the most popular coding languages for web developers, with a third of software developers reporting they used the language in 2022. And in order to take advantage of its greatest strengths, they typically use Java frameworks when creating web apps.\nCreated as templates to be used multiple times, Java frameworks reduce the amount of programming developers must do to develop from-scratch software solutions. Developers use the server-side programming language for a broad range of back-end development projects, including Big Data, Machine Learning, and Web and Android.\nWhy Use Java Frameworks?\nFrameworks give structure to applications. For instance, by creating frameworks for testing, web applications, or ORM (object-relational mapping), developers can automate many processes and get accurate and consistent results. In short, Java frameworks simplify developers’ lives and allow them to focus more on business logic instead of common pieces of code used across a domain or application.\nTop 10 Java Frameworks\nJava frameworks are specific to the Java programming language and can include predefined functions that process, input, and manage hardware as well as interact with system software.\nWhile there are numerous Java-built frameworks, these are the most commonly used for web and network apps as well as logging, testing, and ORM. As each has its distinct benefits and best use cases, we don’t tend to designate one as “better” than the other.\nSpring\nYou’ll find open-source Spring at the top of many developers’ lists of Java frameworks for web apps. A recent survey found that Spring's share grew by about 4% in 2021, with 86% of developers saying they preferred it to other options. Designed to make programming Java easier, quicker, and safer, Spring focuses on simplicity, speed, and productivity, allowing developers to begin building web applications quickly and without fuss.\n2. Apache Struts\nA free, open-source framework used to create elegant, modern Java-based web apps, Struts makes creating maintainable, flexible, and extensible web applications based on standard technologies much more manageable. It relies on the MVC (Model View Controller) framework, and notable features include time-proven design patterns, integration with J2EE, and good tag libraries.\n3. Hibernate\nAlso known as Hibernate ORM, the Hibernate framework simplifies the development of Java applications that interact with databases. Open-source and lightweight, it implements the specifications of JPA (Java Persistence API) for data persistence.\n4. Apache Wicket\nIntroduced in 2004, Wicket uses models to both separate domain layers from view layers in applications and bind them together. Most often used by companies with 50 to 200 employees and one to ten million in revenue, it’s also preferred by major players like Blue Cross Blue Shield. Open-source and component-based, Apache Wicket makes developing web apps simple and enjoyable, making it a fast-growing favorite among developers.\n5. JSF (Java Server Faces)\nAn MVC framework, Java Server Faces or JSF is the standard technology for building component-based MVC frameworks with reusable UI components for server-based applications. Like JSP (Java Server Pages), JSF gives developers access to server-side logic and data and allows them to drag and drop UI components so they can focus more on presentation layer specifics.\n6. Dropwizard\nUsed for developing ops-friendly, high-performance back-ends, Dropwizard features best-in-class Java libraries and components like embedded Jetty, JAX-RS, and JSON. Developers point to its quick project bootstrap, application metrics, and simplified productivity as just some of the reasons they love the framework. Companies like Apple, Oracle, and Expedia agree.\n7. Grails® Framework\nDevelopers who want to spend more time and effort on actual application requirements and less on framework configuring use Grails to streamline web development. Similar to Ruby on Rails, Grails favors high productivity and can do a number of things to improve business efficiency. Fast, extensive, and scalable, developers appreciate Grails’ ready-to-use environment and how it simplifies XML configurations.\n8. Oracle ATG\nATG provides developers with a JavaBeans and JSP component development environment to assemble applications out of component “beans” by linking them together through configuration files. ATG Commerce provides an open, server-side environment for developers to build and deploy dynamic, personalized apps for the web and other communication channels, such as wireless devices and emails.\n9. Play\nSlightly more conventional than other frameworks, Play makes it easy to build web apps with Java and Scala. Based on the MVC pattern, it’s an open-source framework similar to Ruby on Rails and Django. Features developers love include asynchronous processing, statically-typed language, and an extensive relational database.\n10. Hadoop\nAn Apache open-source Java framework, Hadoop uses simple programming models to efficiently store and process bulk datasets across computer clusters, instead of one large computer. Used in industries as varied as fraud detection and social media analysis, Hadoop provides the cheapest, fastest, and smartest way to process and store large volumes of data. It’s a favorite of companies like eBay, Uber, Airbnb, and Shopify.\nZibtek has developed countless successful software projects using Java frameworks.

Is yours one of them?\nA well-designed app can improve your sales and marketing strategies while enhancing the customer experience. Launch a “bad” app, though, and you’re looking at terrible, horrible, no good, very bad results, indeed, including:\nBugs that lead to customer frustration and bad reviews.\nReduced confidence in your expertise.\nA damaged reputation.\nIf you want to develop a mobile app that people will actually use and really appreciate, start by choosing a language that’s not only flexible, scalable, and cost-efficient, but also secure and user-friendly.\nDoes such a beast exist? Yes, and its name is Python.\nWhy Use Python Frameworks?\nPython may be one of the most popular programming languages, but its incompatibility with smartphones tended to hinder its use in building web and mobile apps. Fortunately, numerous frameworks have been developed to help engineers overcome this limitation.\nPython might be one of the most popular programming languages, but its incompatibility with smartphones has hindered its use in building innovative apps. Fortunately, numerous frameworks have been developed to help engineers overcome this limitation.\nPython app frameworks are a collection of modules and packages that allow developers to write applications faster and more efficiently. Dozens of frameworks exist, but some are more popular and in higher demand. In this post, we’re looking at what we consider to be the five best Python frameworks for app development.\nThere are three types of Python frameworks:\n1. Full-stack. Also known as enterprise frameworks, these one-stop solutions include everything from form generators to template layouts and form validation.\n2. Micro-frameworks. More lightweight than full-stack frameworks, microframeworks don’t offer features and functionalities like form validation, database abstraction layers, or specific tools and libraries. But they do offer enough to build applications.\n3. Asynchronous. Relative newcomers, asynchronous frameworks allow developers to handle large sets of concurrent connections.\nPython’s easy learning curve and extensive library collection make it a go-to choice for app development. Before choosing your project’s framework, you need to consider, among other things:\nThe size of the project.\nThe framework’s scalability.\nLearning resources.\nThe core library.\nDocumentation and requirements.\nGenerally, a full-stack framework is best if you’re developing a large, feature-packed system with advanced features. A microframework, on the other hand, might be best if you have a low-requirement app.\nWhat does this mean for your business?\nChoosing a popular and straightforward language like Python for your app means you can keep your development team small and your costs down. It also can mean getting to launch more quickly, letting you strike while the iron is hot. You get an efficient yet innovative app that can be used for a range of business purposes while becoming a critical component of your overall digital transformation.\nTop 5 Python Frameworks for App Development\nAs with any language, each Python framework has distinct advantages and best use cases, and which you choose depends on your needs. Because of that, we don’t assign any one framework a “best” designation, though some are measurably better than others.\nThat said, here’s our list of what we believe to be five of the top Python frameworks based on popularity and ability to provide rapid app development:\n1. Django\nA full-stack framework with a large number of built-in libraries, Django is widely considered the most popular with engineers, mostly due to its pragmatic, clean design and rapid development capabilities. Deemed an excellent tool for creating an application’s back-end, features developers love include:\nIt follows the MVC (model, view controller) pattern which makes code more modular, readable, and reusable.\nIt allows them to quickly build robust applications.\nOnce an app’s created, it can be used with any other app development framework to create cross-platform applications.\nIts excellent template system and other powerful, customizable features.\nUltimately, Django’s beauty lies in its simplicity, flexibility, and scalability which allow developers to deal with literally thousands of requests per second while the framework takes care of database connections, serializing data into cache, and manipulating app configurations.\nSome developers consider Django’s monolithic size a drawback and believe its code-heavy functionalities make it a poor choice for smaller projects.\n2. Web2Py\nWhat makes Web2Py so well-liked is its platform independence, meaning it can run on all popular operating systems. Open-source and full-stack, the framework simplifies the app development process through its dedicated web-based IDE that includes a code editor, debugger, and one-click deployment. Other features include:\nNo installation and configuration prerequisites.\nAbility to read multiple protocols.\nRobust data security.\nError tracking mechanism.\nRole-based access control.\nBackward compatibility.\nOne downside to Web2Py is that it can’t use Python 3.\n3. CherryPy\nReleased over 20 years ago, CherryPy is an elder in the world of microframeworks. The open-source, object-oriented framework takes a minimalistic approach to developing apps, and products created with it are stand-alone apps with multithreaded servers embedded in them.\nWhat do developers love about CherryPy?\nThey can use any technology to access data or create templates.\nIt can run multiple servers simultaneously.\nCaching, encoding, and authentication are all built-in.\nIt runs on Android.\nIt provides a good configuration system.\nIts built-in support for profiling, coverage, and testing.\nCons of CherryPy include a serious lack of documentation, which can slow down a project when developers need to stop and figure out a required feature.\n4. Bottle\nBottle is a fast, simple, and lightweight microframework that’s ideal for prototyping and creating quick online services and apps. Distributed as a single file module, it has no dependencies outside the Python Standard Library.\nAlong with letting developers work closer to the hardware, Bottle’s key highlights include:\nA built-in HTTP server.\nAdapter support for third-party template engines.\nPlugin support for various databases.\nEasy metadata access.\nBottle’s biggest drawback is how difficult it can be to find online support. It’s also fairly challenging for developers to build projects broader than 1000 lines.\n5. Flask\nGreat for any type or size of web application, Flask is a microframework that doesn’t need tools or libraries. Created by Pocoo member and open-source developer Armin Ronacher, the framework started out as an April Fool joke but became popular enough to make it a serious player.\nWhile Flask doesn’t have advanced features like form validation and database abstraction layers, it does come with plenty of extensions. Developers typically choose Flask when they want a simple framework that’s fast enough to serve an uncomplicated project.\nPros include:\nLess Python coding is required to get headers and other features working.\nThe speed at which it’s up and running.\nEasy to learn and use.\nCons are typically slow MVPs (minimum viable product) and higher maintenance costs for complex systems.\nWhy Should I Hire a Python Developer?\nWhile hiring in-house Python developers has advantages like on-site availability, internal business awareness, and in-depth knowledge of business systems, many companies find it more cost-effective and efficient to outsource their projects to a Python development company.\nBenefits of doing so include:\nAccess to top-level talent.\nFreeing you and your IT team to focus on more critical business functions.\nTime and money saved by not having to find, interview, and onboard permanent employees.\nFaster project delivery.\nIn most cases, outsourcing your Python development project gives you access to broader skills, top-notch professional experience, and expertise in the Python framework.\nHow Much Does It Cost to Hire a Python Developer?\nCost deciding factors of Python development vary according to features, duration, development, and maintenance. That means you can expect to pay more if your app requires integration of more complex features or has an intricate design. Rates for Python developers in the US average between $60 and $80 per hour, but rates do fluctuate depending on hiring models and project requirements.\nKeep in mind that the most cost-effective projects are those that are simpler, while those that require more time to build will increase the bottom line. You’ll also need to factor in skills and expertise like:\n1. Problem-solving\n2. Data visualization\n3. Data analysis\n4. Automation scripting\n5. Implementing algorithms and organizing code.\nCost deciding factors of Python development vary according to features, duration, development, and maintenance. That means you can expect to pay more if your app requires integration of more complex features or has an intricate design. If you choose to hire a Python developer in-house, you can expect the total cost to be about $120,000 to $140,00 annually for someone with a minimum of two years experience.\nFor best results, the Python developer you select should have basic front-end and unit test and debugging capabilities as well as problem-solving, data visualization, and data analysis skills.\nWhen choosing to hire a Python development company, think about criteria like rates, time zone differences, and communication skills.

    "extractedText": "Ruby on Rails is Not Dead! 5 Reasons Why.\nJake Barthelmy\nCustom software development with Zibtek’s Product Insights Blog. Discover tips, trends, and strategies for successful product development.\nMore posts by Jake Barthelmy.\nJAKE BARTHELMY\n25 APR 2023 • 5 MIN READ\nOk, let’s cut right to the chase: Ruby on Rails is not dead. It isn’t even on life support. As a Ruby on Rails Consultant and RoR Development Expert company, we’re here to tell you the full-stack framework remains highly relevant in 2023—and we don’t expect that to change any time soon.\nHonestly, what’s not to love about Ruby on Rails? Scalable, cost-effective, and time-efficient, it’s an excellent framework when you want to build high-quality web apps. It’s suitable for multiple operating systems and includes a rich toolkit that’s practical for front and back-end concerns.\nFor these reasons and more, Ruby on Rails outsourcing is one of the best ways to ensure your product is faster to develop, quicker to launch, and more secure.\nWhat is Ruby on Rails Used For?\nDesigned specifically for building web apps, the Ruby-based platform is prized for its easy-to-read and concise code, suitability for SaaS web apps, and perfect balance of function and imperative programming (the step-by-step process for a program’s execution). The dynamic, open-source language, which was released in 2004, focuses on simplicity and productivity and is typically used for:\n· Social networking sites that require complex user interactions like messaging and notifications.\n· Online marketplaces such as Etsy and Airbnb.\n· Business apps that manage workflows, data, and other resources.\n· Building and managing content-rich websites that feature blogs and forums.\n· eCommerce platforms, including shopping carts, payment processing, and inventory management.\nIt’s also ideal for those times you want to streamline and automate app installations and configuration. And with a bit of help from Python, Ruby on Rails can also help clean, transform, and validate data.\n5 Reasons Rails Technology is Not Dead\nOnce in a while you’ll hear someone ask, “Whatever happened to Ruby on Rails?” Nothing! Yes, Python and JavaScript “rule the world,” but Ruby is no relic of the past; its present and future relevancy remain strong.\nWe’ve put together this list of reasons why Ruby on Rails isn’t dead, not so much to convince anyone it’s still alive and kicking, but rather to illustrate why it’s not going anywhere.\nRuby on Rails is Not Dead! 5 Reasons Why.\n1. eCommerce, baby.\nMany experts agree that Ruby on Rails is still the best framework out there for creating eCommerce apps. Its dynamic functionality and flexibility, they say, make it far easier to update an app with additional features as needs and customer demands evolve.\n2. A buzzing community.\nOne of Ruby on Rail’s most attractive characteristics is its far-reaching community. When developers want to find solutions to annoying problems, learn something new, or unearth some cool gems, they turn to fellow Ruby enthusiasts.\n3. Consistent updates and maintenance.\nIt’s a good sign when a framework receives regular updates and maintenance, as it indicates continuing demand. Developers and the Rails development team routinely update the framework, adding key features and fixing bugs to ensure its relevance and stability; Rails 7.0.4, 6.1.7, and 6.0.6 were released in late 2022.\n4. Supreme flexibility in agile development.\nBecause Ruby prioritizes convention over configuration, it’s a terrific choice for agile development and Minimum Viable Products (MVPs). Engineers can use the framework to develop stunning web apps much more cost efficiently. And since it’s scalable, your business’s digital assets can grow quickly when the need arises.\n5. Full stack functionality.\nBecause it’s a full-stack framework that allows for performing both front and back-end solutions, developers can use Ruby on Rails to build an entire web application.\nIt’s worth addressing why some people assume Ruby on Rails is dead. Mostly, it comes down to greater competition. When the Ruby framework was introduced nearly two decades ago, it was a one-of-a-kind product. But as new solutions with similar or superior features began to appear, it lost some of its luster.\nMost criticism of Ruby on Rails centers on:\n· Slow performance (but fast in terms of development speed).\n· Complex syntax, which shouldn’t be confused with simple architecture.\n· It isn’t AI or ML-friendly. That’s why there’s Python!\nThe bottom line? Just because Rails isn’t as popular as it used to be (it ranks 14th with professional developers), it doesn’t mean the technology is dying or dead. It’s still a perfect choice for startups and small businesses and extremely convenient for development teams. And it’s why it still lands in the top 20 most-used programming languages.\nRuby on Rails is Not Dead! 5 Reasons Why.\nWhat Companies Use Ruby on Rails?\nMajor players using Ruby Framework include:\n1. Airbnb. Used by more than 150 million users worldwide for over one billion booked stays, the online marketplace uses Ruby for its payment stack.\n2. GitHub. Developers use GitHub to collaborate, manage, and share their projects. Today, more than 100 million GitHub projects are frequently modified and updated.\n3. Shopify. Used by some of the world’s biggest brands, the eCommerce platform uses Ruby on Rails as its primary server-side application programming language.\n4. Ernst & Young. The Big Four accounting firm has Rails as a significant element in its website architecture.\n5. Hulu. Ruby on Rails was used to build the video streaming platform, which has nearly 50 million subscribers in the U.S.\nAnd the list goes on. Etsy, Crunchbase, Basecamp, Coinbase, and Kickstarter are some of the largest companies using Ruby on Rails. But the framework is also a popular choice for startups and small businesses who benefit from its low cost of entry and rapid development capabilities. In fact, it’s estimated that over 434,000 websites in the science and education, arts & entertainment, gaming, and technology sectors use Ruby.\nWhy Outsource Rails Development to Zibtek?\nWhen it comes to building high-performing web apps, Ruby on Rails is an excellent choice. However, not all software development companies have the expertise, experience, or resources to handle Ruby on Rails development.\nZibtek’s proven reputation as a world-leading Ruby on Rails Consultant and RoR Development Expert means you get to tap into a pool of highly skilled and experienced engineers without having to build an internal team. We shape your product team to fit your current needs and match you with developers who blend seamlessly with your company’s culture and existing staff.

If you’re ready to start the hard work of developing custom software but lack the resources and expertise to do it yourself, outsourcing can be the solution you need.\nNearly three-quarters of businesses worldwide outsource IT-related operations, and mobile app development has quickly taken the front position. In this post we’ll cover the steps to take, the costs to expect, and the mistakes to avoid when outsourcing your software development.\nWhy Outsource App Development?\nWe should build an app! It’s become the top priority for businesses looking to increase revenue and expand their presence. Whether you want to develop an app for your startup, optimize your internal operations, or take your brand online, there are plenty of benefits to outsourcing software development.\nA talented team of developers. In-house software development can have its upside, but few companies can afford to maintain a team of highly qualified engineers who have the varied skillsets needed.\nTime savings. Everyone wants the development process to progress as quickly as possible. How long it takes to get your project to completion varies according to the scope of the problem. But big or small, what most affects the speed of your software development is the team of specialists who work on it. Outsourcing eliminates the need to bring in additional permanent staff. Instead, you get an experienced team of developers who have established communication channels and a proven process that lets you further your project more quickly.\nCost savings. It can be expensive to put your own software development team together. When you outsource software development, it’s estimated you can save up to 50% of the costs related to searching for, interviewing, training, and providing benefits to candidates.\nThere are also costly expenses associated with in-house software development. Mistakes by a non-specialized team, underfunding, poor team management, and dated dev tools and app platforms are just a few.\nHow to Successfully Outsource App Development\nWhen you outsource app development to a professional provider, you gain a strategic partnership for all stages of the development process. Far beyond writing code, outside software development services are always prepared to:\nDiscuss their process and recommend the best options.\nProvide timely updates and reports on different steps such as sprint planning, backlog grooming, and refinement meetings.\nAdjust and change priorities when needed.\nHere are two critical strategies for choosing an outsourcing partner:\nIdentify the functions you want your app to perform. Any good software developer can create a design, but a well-defined structure ensures your completed product is the one you envisioned. Creating an app roadmap gives clarity to the project and helps you create an app people enjoy using.\nCreate a budget that accurately reflects your goals and find a quality software development firm that can help you meet it. Custom app development is not the time to be cutting corners on skills and expertise. Often what it comes down to is choosing the best development method that falls into your budget.\nWhat costs should you expect? That depends a lot on which resources you need to complete your project. Along with the remuneration for the development team, other variables can affect your costs, such as those related to additional work or rework, travel expenses, legal issues, and management overhead. The best way to determine your true costs and savings is to speak with a software developer and then compare the estimated costs with what you’d spend to do the work in-house.\nMistakes to Avoid in Outsourcing App Development\nAvoid these common mistakes when choosing an app development partner and you’ll significantly improve your chances of a successful, satisfying experience.\nDon’t avoid verifying the company’s credentials. Look at the developer’s previous work, read online reviews, and ask questions, lots of questions.\nClearly communicate your specifications and requirements. This is the only way the developer can honestly assess if it’s the right fit for you.\nBe realistic about goals and deadlines. Even the most skilled developers have a process they must follow. And in the end, you’ll have a product that likely exceeds your expectations.\nStay involved to ensure the project is going in the right direction. Rework can set your schedule and budget back considerably. It’s also a good idea to have the app tested by your internal team.\nDon’t place price above quality. Good or bad, your new app will represent your brand in the market. Getting it right the first time is well worth the financial investment.\nWe know there are thousands of companies to choose from when you decide to outsource app development. Few of them deliver truly high-quality service. At Zibtek, we’re focused on providing exceptional software development experiences for all our clients. If you have a custom app project you’re hoping to get off the ground, we’d love to discuss it with you! LinkedIn Twitter Email"

    "extractedText": "BUSINESS\nAirbnb API\nIan J.H Reynolds\nExplore Ian J.H Reynolds' expertise in finance and economics through his insightful articles on market trends, investment strategies, and economic analysis.\nMore posts by Ian J.H Reynolds.\nIAN J.H REYNOLDS\n23 JUL 2020 • 6 MIN READ\nAirbnb started out in 2008 with a mission to revolutionize vacation rentals. It has since grown into a multi-billion dollar company with near global presence and a strong brand equity. The platform it has created allows hosts to list their empty bedrooms and properties that travelers can rent for as little as one day and up to several months at a time.\nIt does a lot more than just provide a marketplace to connect hosts and travels now, though. Airbnb has since expanded its offerings beyond just rooms and apartments. It now lists local experiences on its platform, has dedicated high-end listings for the more discerning travelers and is looking into expanding further in the hospitality industry.\nThe platform has also enabled people to launch their own real estate rental businesses. They only need to supply the property. Everything else like the listing, payments and customer support is handled by Airbnb’s platform. It has proven to be a lucrative business opportunity and Airbnb actively supports business owners on its platform with an API.\nWhat is an API?\nTwo software applications can't talk to each other on their own unless there's something that can facilitate that. An API is what makes that happen. The Application Programming Interface (API) is the intermediary that lets two software applications talk to each other. They’re used much more frequently than most people would imagine.\nAPIs also make life much easier for developers. Operating systems like iOS and Android provide developers with a significant number of APIs.\nSo, for example, if a developer wants to embed a browser to show web pages, they don't have to code a web browser from scratch just for their application. They can use the WKWEBView API to embed a WebKit (Safari) browser in their iOS app.\nAccess to the camera interface would be another prime example. If an app needs to capture photos from the device's camera, the developers don't necessarily need to create their own camera interface. They can simply use the operating system's camera API to embed the native camera interface into their app.\nAPIs also play a major role in security. They're also used for access control on hardware and software functionality that an app may not have the permission to access. For example, an app that tries to access the device's camera through an API could be refused permission to do so by the user when prompted. This would leave the app with no other way of accessing the camera.\nUnderstanding the Airbnb API\nAirbnb launched its very own API back in 2017. The company has always been very careful about picking the external partners that it worked with. While many had been asking for it, Airbnb had never before made an API available to allow other companies to create products around its platform.\nIt finally embraced the developer community in 2017 with its Official Airbnb API. It finally allowed external developers to access the API. The API isn't publicly accessible, though, so it’s up to Airbnb to decide who is granted access.\nAirbnb can be very picky still about the partners that it chooses to work with, and that makes it difficult to get access to its API. While many companies choose to make their APIs publicly accessible, Airbnb is swimming against the tide here.\nHow the Airbnb API can help your business\nThe Airbnb API can prove to be very useful for those who list a lot of properties on the platform. The API gives developers an incentive to create tools that allow property managers that list on Airbnb to effectively exercise control over their listings. Such software was previously not available since it wasn’t possible for third-party apps to interface with the company’s platform.\nWith the API, development teams can securely Oauth into new and existing Airbnb accounts. They will be able to provide people who use their applications the ability to push updates to the content on their listings, update the rates and availability for all of their listings through one app.\nRemember, APIs allow software to talk to each other, this means that Airbnb's platform can also send data back to the custom apps. As Airbnb guests make bookings, the API can then pass back reservation and messaging details. This will enable property managers to create custom workflows that allow them to streamline their business and operate it more efficiently.\nHow to get the Airbnb API\nAirbnb has never made its API publicly accessible. Even though it has embraced the developer community, which it took a very long time to do, it still exercises strict control over who can be provided access to the API.\nPreviously, the company required all interested parties to fill out a form. They had to provide details in the application form which would allow the company’s partnership managers to decide whether or not they should provide access to the API.\nAirbnb has put a pause on that for the time being. The company is currently not accepting any new access requests for its API. Instead, its global team of partner managers is reaching out to prospective partners based on the supply opportunity that their business represents, the strength of their technology, and the ability to support shared customers.\nThe best bet remains to try and get in touch with the company directly or through an introduction to the partner managers. It’s unclear when Airbnb might bring back the simple application form again.\nOnce the partner has been approved, Airbnb will provide them with API documentation so that they can put together their development timeline. The developers can then complete their work and launch their application.\nIf they have any questions, they can reach out to their Airbnb partner manager for assistance. Once that's done, they can then begin onboarding their lodging inventory on the Airbnb platform through the API connection and start welcoming travelers from across the globe.\nIntegrating an Airbnb API into your business\nAs previously detailed, there are significant benefits to integrating the Airbnb API into your business. Managing one single property listing on Airbnb is pretty straightforward. You just log into the platform and make any changes to the listing content, availability and rates. There’s no need to make bulk changes or improvements.\nWhat if you have dozens of listings, though? If you’re having maintenance carried out at all of your properties, you’ll have to manually update their availability on the platform. That’s going to take a lot of time and the process is just going to be clunky.\nA custom property management software that communicates with the platform using Airbnb’s API will enable you to quickly update the availability for all of those properties in just a few clicks.\nThis will also allow for significant reduction in repetitive tasks, freeing up more time for you to focus on the things that really matter. It’s one of the easiest ways to make your job of managing multiple properties on Airbnb simpler.\nImagine having to deal with messages from hundreds of potential renters, automated messages would allow property managers to keep their response rates high while also ensuring that any questions that people may have about their listings are quickly answered.\nWith an API-connected software, they can utilize their existing email flows and automated messages to respond to guests. A higher response rate is an indication to guests that the host actively engages in communication. This makes them more likely to book as they have peace of mind that the host will be available in case they run into any issues during their stay.\nIf developers need any technical support beyond what's already described in the technical documentation for the API, its global team of partner managers are always on hand to provide assistance.\nGet professional help with API integration\nIt’s vital that API integration is done right since there’s a lot of potential for things to go wrong. An API is a bridge between two pieces of software that would otherwise not be able to communicate. If the implementation has been botched, the entire logic behind utilizing the API would crumble.\nThis requires trusting the job to experienced developers who are highly skilled when it comes to integrating custom software solutions with APIs. Zibtek can be your partner in this endeavor.\nZibtek is one of the world’s leading software development companies. It has worked with both Fortune 500 companies and startups alike, helping them achieve success by fulfilling their software needs.

    "extractedText": "BUSINESS\nHow to Build a Payment Gateway\nIan J.H Reynolds\nExplore Ian J.H Reynolds' expertise in finance and economics through his insightful articles on market trends, investment strategies, and economic analysis.\nMore posts by Ian J.H Reynolds.\nIAN J.H REYNOLDS\n16 JUL 2020 • 6 MIN READ\nWe’re so used to paying for products and services online that most of us don’t realize the sheer scale of technological advancement that has gone into making this possible over the past few decades. After all, it has only been a couple of decades or so since we have been able to pay for products and services online.\nPayment gateways have been at the forefront of enabling us to make payments online without even breaking a sweat. The technology has come a long way since its inception and it now supports a variety of integrations to allow customers to seamlessly use the payment services and cards that they prefer to make online payments.\nWhat is a payment gateway?\nIf you’re looking to sell products and services online, it’s crucial to understand precisely what a payment gateway is, what it does and why you need to have one for your online marketplace. Your business won’t be able to survive without it.\nWithout a payment gateway, it will be impossible for you to process payments online. It's the framework which allows online credit card authorization and payments processing by facilitating communication between banks.\nIf a customer enters their card information on your website to purchase a product, how will their card be charged? The payment gateway is going to make that happen. The software and servers that transmit their card information to acquiring banks and revert back with a response from an issuing bank are collectively known as payment gateways.\nWithout a response from the issuing bank about whether the transaction has been approved or declined, you won't be able to know if the customer has actually been able to pay for your product.\nSince the primary reason payment gateways exist is to transmit payment information, which is highly sensitive and needs to be protected from bad actors at all costs, the payment gateways are held to a very strict security standard known as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS).\nPayment information theft is one of the most common threats online. Hackers routinely try to hack into payment gateways in order to steal customers’ credit card information which can then be misused. Therefore, it’s essential for payment gateways to ensure that they’re always in compliance with the security standards.\nPayment gateways don't actually process the transaction themselves. They merely bring the information to the payment processor that's used by the acquiring bank. It's then up to the payment processor to forward that information to a card association like Visa or MasterCard which then routes the transaction to the relevant bank which issued the customer's card.\nHow does it differ from a payment service provider?\nA payment service provider is a third-party service which enables a business to accept online payments from their customers. A lot of businesses, particularly startups, may not have the time or resources to set up their own payment gateway. They may also not have the required business credentials to obtain their individual merchant account from an acquiring bank.\nPayment service providers exist in order to enable these businesses to accept payments. They offer a one-stop solution in which the transmission of payment information and the payment processing is carried out by the service provider in return for a per-transaction fee. This is what moves the money from your customers’ bank to yours.\nThis also eliminates the need for business owners to build their own fraud protection systems or ensure PCI-DSS compliance as far as the payments processing is concerned. All of that burden is shouldered by the payment service provider. Another benefit of opting for a third-party service is that they offer additional functionality such as the ability to process transactions in multiple currencies, sell recurring subscriptions, and more.\nPayment gateways differ from service providers because the latter is responsible for a lot more than just transmitting payment information and reverting back with the response.\nOnce the transaction request is received by the card issuing bank, it will communicate a response back to the payment service provider with either an authorization or a denial with a response code which could be related to bank link downtime or simply insufficient funds.\nThis response is then fed to the payment gateway which brings it back to the website or app that was used to make the payment so that it can be relayed to the customer. Normally, this entire process is completed under 5 seconds. It's impressive that such complex tasks are carried out on a massive scale every single day in mere seconds.\nWhy do you need a payment gateway for an online marketplace?\nPayment gateways are essential because they form the financial link between an online business and the customer. If it doesn't exist, the customer is simply unable to pay for the product or service online. You need a payment gateway for your online business as it's going to help facilitate online transactions.\nYour customers also need to be assured of security. Given the increasing knowledge about the risks that exist online, customers are becoming more conscious about where they enter their card details. If you're using a payment gateway, they can rest assured that their payment information will be transmitted with encryption and will be kept secure.\nUsing a payment gateway also enables you to exercise control over the check out experience on your online store, thus allowing you to keep your customers on the store itself when processing their payments.\nHow to build a payment gateway:\nIf you want to integrate a payment gateway on your online marketplace and also wish to have complete control over its functionality and usability, then you need to have a custom payment gateway developed.\nCustom payment gateways actually make sense for a lot of online marketplaces. They can be created to fit the unique payment flow of your marketplace, something that an off-the-shelf service might find difficult.\nIf your organization has a team of software engineers that can make payment gateways, then that's a great way to go about this. Another popular and most cost effective solution is to bring in a third-party software development company to build the custom payment gateway for you.\nThe process will be time-consuming, though, as the developers will have to carry out rigorous testing to ensure that everything is working as it should be. The biggest advantage of this is obviously having tools that are uniquely developed for your particular payment flow. Since you will have more control over the entire process, it will also allow you to offer a much seamless payments experience to users.\nFor businesses that are more privacy conscious, this is the best possible solution out there. A custom payment gateway will need to be run on separate infrastructure which means that it will run on your own servers.\nThis means that no other company will have access to the historical payment data of your customers in addition to other relevant data. All of that can be kept in servers that are directly under your control.\nGet the right help crafting a payment gateway for your business\nWe understand that this can seem to be a bit overwhelming at first, especially if you have no prior experience with setting up payment gateways or working with payment service providers. Fortunately, it’s quite easy to understand the basics of these services and then use them to grow a business online.\nIf you feel that your organization will benefit from a custom payment gateway, then you need to get the work started on it right away. Full-scale development of a custom solution is going to take a substantial amount of time.\nYou don’t have to worry about hiring an army of software developers as employees of your company to create a payment gateway for your business. You can trust Zibtek with that job. Zibtek is one of the world’s fastest growing software companies, working with clients that include Fortune 500 companies and startups alike.\nZibtek can assign developers from its global talent pool that’s managed from within the United States to work on your project.

    "extractedText": "BUSINESS\nCrystal Reports\nIan J.H Reynolds\nExplore Ian J.H Reynolds' expertise in finance and economics through his insightful articles on market trends, investment strategies, and economic analysis.\nMore posts by Ian J.H Reynolds.\nIAN J.H REYNOLDS\n8 JUL 2020 • 6 MIN READ\nData is a wonderful thing. It's something that can make or break a business, provide it with the tools to grow and thrive in the market. That’s really the reason why so many business intelligence services and tools exist.\nBusinesses want to be able to track a wide variety of metrics. They can then look at the data to figure out what their customers want, what their spending patterns are, which products are doing better compared to others, where additional efficiency can be gained, etc.\nAll this and more can be accurately tracked with the relevant tools and services. Crystal Reports happens to be one of them, and it’s also one of the most widely used business intelligence tools for small to medium organizations.\nWhat is Crystal Reports?\nCrystal Reports got its start at Quik Reports when it was originally developed almost three decades ago. The product was developed because at that time, its developers couldn't find a suitable commercial report writer for their accounting software. The company then traded hands a few times before eventually being acquired by SAP in 2007.\nCrystal Reports can power pixel-perfect reporting for businesses. This solution enables organizations to combine analysis, business intelligence and decision support based on their data. The tool can analyze multiple data sources and then create visualizations of the data in charts and tables. These charts and tables can be grouped in documents and dashboards which can then be used in static or dynamic format.\nHow does it work?\nData collection is at the heart of how Crystal Reports works as it will be unable to function if the required information is not fed into the system. A business can collect a wide variety of data on their customers in addition to the data that they already have about their own processes.\nFor example, it can be things like details of transactions, loyalty card usage, production records, web logs, sales point addresses, financial information, and more. This data is usually stored in databases like SAP HANA, MS Access or MS SQL Server as well as simple text files or MS Excel.\nSAP Crystal Reports allows one or multiple users within an organization to securely access this data in order to visualize trends and patterns, analyze facts, rank and filter the data to further drill down into specific areas.\nPixel-perfect reporting takes it a step further. Once charts and tables have been created in Crystal Reports, a pixel-perfect document can be created as a business overview to share with investors, a list of invoices to send to customers, etc. These documents can then be used as a template because every time the data source is updated, the document can also be refreshed with a simple click or automatically.\nHow much does Crystal Reports cost?\nPricing for Crystal Reports starts at $495. This is a one-time fee for a single user and offers the ability to manually distribute an unlimited number of reports to as many recipients as you want. The software is installed on a Windows PC or server with one license per individual. It can run on its own or with the SAP Crystal Server to be operated both online and offline.\nFor small businesses, the price starts at $1,060 with 1 named user who also gets access to the mobile app. This includes an unlimited number of scheduled reports that can be distributed automatically to an unlimited number of recipients.\nPricing for medium businesses starts at $11,728 with one named user, app access, five concurrent access users across the web and mobile version. It also includes an unlimited number of scheduled reports personalized for each user that can be distributed automatically to as many recipients as needed.\nSAP does offer a 30 day free trial of Crystal Reports. This allows you to access the full version of the tool and take all of its features for a trial run. The free month will be enough for most organizations to decide whether or not this is something that they want to implement.\nWhat can you use Crystal Reports for\nYou can use Crystal Reports for generating reports from both SAP and non-SAP data sources. It makes it very easy to create advanced level reports that managers and business leaders in your organization can use to make better strategic decisions.\nPixel-perfect Reporting\nThere are many business intelligence tools that allow you to create pixel-perfect reports. That's something that you can also do with Crystal Reports, and it's actually something that this tool is pretty great at.\nWith pixel-perfect reporting, you have control of every component down to the individual pixel level. This operational report is thus created exactly to the specification required by you. Such high precision reports are very useful when it comes to making strategic business decisions.\nPixel-perfect reporting is also ideal for when a report needs to be created with a precise layout that can easily be scaled with large amounts of data with support for multiple file formats.\nDetailed data analysis\nData that's spread across different databases isn't being utilized to its full potential. The only way you can get a sense of the complete picture is when all of the data is pooled into a centralized place to create reports and visualizations that include all of the tracked metrics.\nCrystal Reports streamlines data analysis and really enables users to navigate data down to the granular level. They can use this tool to identify patterns in their data, filter and sort through it for a better overview, and integrate formulas to get more out of their tracked metrics.\nIt's easy to pull in data from multiple sources as well. Crystal Reports relies on straightforward data connection procedures and can connect to all sources with ODBC, OLE DB, JDBC, native and SAP connections. It enables users to bring data together from multiple sources into a single report.\nCreate interactive dashboards\nWith Crystal Reports, any data source that your organization uses can be transformed into an interactive dashboard with charts, tables, maps and logos. This puts actionable information at your fingertips that can be accessed online and offline from portals, applications and mobile devices.\nThis tool can be used to create the specific data view that's better suited to your business. This versatility is the reason why so many businesses rely on Crystal Reports to visualize their data sources.\nThe dashboard lets you easily analyze all of your business data with features like built-in sorting, ranking, formulas, conditional formatting, grouping, and parameters. Search capabilities are built into the software as well so finding any specific piece of data is possible as well.\nIntegrating Crystal Reports Into Your Custom Business Solution\nBy now, you have come to understand that Crystal Reports can be a great tool in your arsenal. You might be wondering if the implementation process is complicated or would require a significant investment on your part. It’s implementation is fairly straightforward as well, as there’s enough flexibility in the system to allow it to run through apps and mobile devices.\nIt’s possible that you may already have a custom software solution for your business, one that you use to track different metrics and to analyze the overall performance. You don’t need to scrap that solution in order to utilize Crystal Reports. This wouldn’t sit right with many business owners who have already invested significant resources in having their custom software solutions developed. Having to scrap that would be an incredible waste.\nThe great thing about this tool is that it can be integrated into your existing software solutions as well. So there’s no need to scrap your existing solutions and waste the investment that has already been made. The highly skilled developers at Zibtek can help you with the integration process.\nZibtek is one of the fastest growing software companies in the world. It counts both Fortune 500 companies and startups among its clients. Zibtek is based in the United States with offices in Salt Lake, Utah.

Various business departments have their own data requirements, they process it differently and have their own data models that they follow.\nIf it’s not all being fed into a centralized system, it can create a lot of friction between the different departments. Suddenly, collaboration takes a hit, as people end up having to spend more time sorting through the different data sets in order to access the information that they require.\nThere are also many mundane back-office tasks that can be automated, this helps improve efficiency and ensures that your business is able to extract the most value out of its employees’ time\nWhat is Enterprise Resource Planning?\nEnterprise Resource Planning or ERP software is designed with this express purpose in mind. It’s meant to reduce this friction between the different departments in an organization. At its core, ERP software is an integrated software suite that enables businesses to use apps to manage and automate many different business functions.\nIt was the Gartner Group that actually came up with the term Enterprise Resource Planning. This new word was coined so that the focus could be kept entirely on the new digital solutions that enabled businesses to effectively share data between departments, control inventory, manage supply chain relations, automate accounting tasks, and more.\nThere are several different types of ERP implementation that businesses can opt for, depending upon their needs. An on-premise implementation means that the ERP software is deployed directly on the devices that are present on the premises.\nMost businesses also prefer cloud-based ERP solutions as they offer more mobility. Others have found their sweet spot with hybrid implementations which includes a mix of both on-premise and cloud-based deployment.\n11 ways ERP services can help your business\nA robust Enterprise Resource Planning software will enable your company to meet a wide range of business challenges that would otherwise require either the hiring of a significant number of resources to handle the tasks on outsourcing on a large scale. Both of these solutions are often not suitable for many companies.\nReduces Fragmentation\nOne of the fundamental benefits of an ERP solution is that it unifies many of the systems that your organization uses. Reducing fragmentation of the systems that your employees rely on is key to improving efficiency and further streamlining processes.\nWhether they need to quickly look up inventory before ordering additional materials or study the production plan, your staff will be able to do all of that from one centralized system. This will make them more efficient and that will lead to increased efficiency across the entire organization.\nSaves Money\nInitially, it might seem that paying for an ERP solution is too big of an investment. However, once you move beyond the initial sticker shock, you will come to realize that this suite of integrated applications can actually help you save money in the long run.\nYou no longer have to train employees on different systems, delegated employees to deal with different vendors and no longer have to make system upgrades for each individual system.\nEnhanced Analytics\nWhat's the biggest benefit of having a centralized location for all of the data? It allows for more enhanced analytics. An ERP solution is going to record and store all of the data input from across the organization.\nIt effectively serves as a robust business intelligence tool as employees are able to generate detailed reports within seconds, reports that would otherwise take a lot of time to compile, particularly if data had to be gathered from different departments manually.\nBetter Inventory Management\nTracking expanding inventory levels remains a significant challenge for businesses. It's vital for sufficient inventory levels to be maintained otherwise the entire supply chain could come tumbling down.\nERP solutions can utilize technologies like RFID tags, serial numbers and barcodes to improve inventory monitoring. If your business has multiple warehouses, the centralized system will be able to display inventory levels across all locations, show which items are in transportation and which items need to be restocked.\nImproved Customer Service\nIt’s very important for businesses to provide exceptional customer service. They run the risk of losing repeat business from existing customers. ERP solutions can help in this aspect as well since they come with a customer relationship management tool. An integrated CRM will help your sales team provide better customer service.\nReduce Risk\nData is everything in the digital age which means that it's also at risk. There's no shortage of bad actors out there that are looking to gain unauthorized access to data. If your business operates online then it's data is at risk. ERP solutions include risk management tools which can be utilized to perform security audits.\nBetter Collaboration Between Departments\nInternal communication becomes absolutely necessary as a business grows. Different departments need to collaborate with each other seamlessly in order to ensure that all of the business goals are being met.\nThis is even more important for businesses that have offices and resources across the globe. Any miscommunication between teams can lead to unnecessary business disruptions and that's best avoided. ERP solutions include communication tools that can power instant internal communication.\nAccounting And Payroll Management\nFinancial matters need to be handled with the utmost care, even more so if you have a large organization that employs hundreds or thousands of employees. In that case, manual accounting and payroll management is simply out of the question.\nEven for smaller organizations, the accounting and payroll management modules of a custom ERP system can help significantly streamline this important business process.\nScalability\nA custom ERP solution can be structured and scalable, in that it would be possible to increase the number of users and functions as your organization grows. You don't have to pay for the service and functionality for thousands of users initially, ERP systems can easily be scaled up as and when required.\nRegulatory Compliance\nYour business doesn't want to be on the regulators' bad side. There's no avoiding the fact that your business will have to deal with regulators and ensure compliance. This can often be a tedious process and if something is not done right, there's always the risk of being penalized.\nAn ERP system can help keep track of industry regulations and also to monitor any changes in compliance. This aids in the overall risk management for the business and allows the organization to quickly adapt should the regulatory environment change. This ensures that you never find yourself not being compliant with the rules, thereby reducing the risk of being penalized for something that could have been avoided.\nFully Customizable Solution\nOne of the biggest advantages of an ERP solution is that it can be fully customized to your organization. It doesn’t need to be an off-the-shelf solution, so you’ll never be paying for features or integrations that have no use in your line of work.\nWith a fully customized solution, you will have the peace of mind that the solution that you have paid for has been developed specifically with your business needs in mind. This thus provides a greater return on the investment that you make for this integrated suite.\nGet the ERP services you need\nIf you're looking to have a custom Enterprise Resource Planning system developed, Zibtek is going to be the perfect partner for your project.

    "extractedText": "BUSINESS\nData Migration Services\nIan J.H Reynolds\nExplore Ian J.H Reynolds' expertise in finance and economics through his insightful articles on market trends, investment strategies, and economic analysis.\nMore posts by Ian J.H Reynolds.\nIAN J.H REYNOLDS\n5 JUN 2020 • 6 MIN READ\nRemember the dread you feel when switching phones? There’s always that worry in the back of the mind that we could lose some of our precious data when switching between the two devices. It’s more nerve-wracking when shifting from one OS to another, as the platform differences could cause issues with data transfer.\nNow imagine you’re a business or a large corporation with terabytes of data. The thought of migrating data while the business continues to function is enough to give your IT people sleepless nights. The fact is that data migration requires specialized knowledge.\nIt’s not the same as backing up data to a hard drive or the cloud. That’s the number one reason why businesses choose to trust specialized data migration firms with the job. It may be tempting to do the work in-house, but there would always be a significant amount of risk involved, and data is not something that businesses should have a cavalier attitude about.\nWhy would you need data migration?\nThe act of data migration might sound very simple. It's just the process of moving data from one location to another, but it's easier said than done. Businesses never have the option to just tap on a button and see decades worth of data just zip to a new location. Much work has to be done before that in order to facilitate a successful migration.\nThe need for data migration arises when a new system is being implemented or the data needs to be stored in a new location. So you’d need the services for data migration specialists when you deploy a new internal management system and shift your entire workforce over from the old one.\nYou’d also require a reliable data migration service when shifting huge amounts of data from one data center to another. There might be a few reasons when you might need to do that. Your business could be moving to cloud storage or simply shifting data from an external data center to on-premises servers.\nYou need data migration because it's a necessary part of either upgrading or consolidating your data storage or when new software systems are being implemented. There’s great risk if the job isn’t done properly. Your business could face disruption if the legacy systems no longer function and all of the data hasn’t been sent over to the new systems. Clearly, this is a job best left to the professionals.\nWhat kind of data can you migrate?\nEvery business has unique data needs but in most cases, a technology refresh in the company would require migrating all storage data. For example, if you're equipping your workforce with new computers, it would be imperative that all of the company data is safely migrated from the old machines.\nThere's also database migration. This would be required if your company data is being transferred from one location to another. It may involve changing data centers or simply uploading all of it to a cloud storage service. This massive transfer of data will also be required if the company is being moved to a new database management system.\nApplication migration related to the transfer of data within an application. It's often needed when the workforce is being moved between applications. For example, application migration would need data to be transferred from an on-premises implementation of Microsoft Office to Office 365 in the cloud.\nOver the past few years, cloud migration has been one of the biggest challenges that companies have faced. They have realized the benefits of moving databases to the cloud but shifting all of the data from legacy systems can be a risky process.\nIt's pertinent to note that this process isn't the same as just backing up the data to the cloud. An entirely new source environment needs to be created in the cloud first and then usually presents its own set of challenges.\nWhy it’s smart to use data migration services\nAsk anyone in this business and they'll tell you that data migration can be a risky process. Even if it ends up going smoothly, the process itself isn't easy as it's highly time intensive with many different planning and implementation steps that need to be taken first.\nThe project will only get riskier as the scale of the data that needs to be migrated grows. Catastrophic data loss at a massive scale can shut down a company and that's not a desirable outcome. The smart thing to do is to always retain the services of data migration specialists who know what they're doing.\nDo-it-yourself data migration is never a smart strategy, unless you have a massive in-house team, and that's really not the case for most companies. There are just too many variables in the entire process with compatibility issues between platforms, user access rights between source and target systems, unknown file formats, to name a few.\nWhat kind of services do data migration firms offer?\nData migration firms kick things off with forming a strategy and planning how the job will be executed. This involves understanding the design requirements for the data that's to be migrated, forming migration schedules, capacity planning, and prioritizing by data value.\nThey discuss the migration implementation schedule with the company to decide if it will be a \"big bang\" migration - which involves the data being migrated in a limited time window with minimal downtime, or a \"trickle\" migration - which takes longer but with less downtime.\nAnother key service that they provide involves working with the end users to ensure that everyone is on the same page. Data migration isn't just a technical process. Your workforce will understandably be anxious about any data loss during the migration and that would directly impact their jobs.\nData migration firms work with end users to make them understand the process and also to learn from them what they're hoping to get out of the move, whether that's better performance, improved analytics, etc.\nLet's go back to the phone example for a bit. The best practise when moving your data from one phone to another is to always create a backup first. This is done to ensure that the data will remain safe even if the process doesn't go smoothly.\nData migration firms do this at a massive scale. They create safe backups and establish immediate restoration protocols so that the business can be up and running again in no time if something unexpected happens during the migration.\nOther benefits of using a data migration service\nData migration service providers aren’t strictly bound to just moving your data from one place to another. They also provide a variety of other services. For example, they can perform audits on your data to filter out obsolete records, filter unused feeds and more to optimize the data before it's migrated.\nIf you have decades worth of data to be migrated, you'd be surprised by the sheer amount of dark data that surfaces during the audit or the obsolete records that are just clogging up your database. Data migration firms can clean up all of that clutter for you.\nThe job doesn't end there, though. They also have to perform various tests on the migration via a mirror of the production environment. This is done to make sure that everything is working as it should be before the new data environment goes live. That's also done very carefully and once it's clear that the job is a success, only then is the legacy system shut down.\nWe can help you with data migration on any scale\nYou have come to understand by now that data migration can be very beneficial for a business. It can help improve efficiency and bolster security of your data. You’ve also realized that the job is best left to the professionals because there are significant risks involved.\nAny loss of data on a massive scale can potentially cause irreparable damage to your business. That’s not something you’d want to see happening which is why Zibtek is here to help you out.\nZibtek is a leading software company that has for decades worked with companies both big and small, from Fortune 500 conglomerates to startups.

    "extractedText": "BUSINESS\n11 Reasons Your Business Might Need a Custom Mobile App\nIan J.H Reynolds\nExplore Ian J.H Reynolds' expertise in finance and economics through his insightful articles on market trends, investment strategies, and economic analysis.\nMore posts by Ian J.H Reynolds.\nIAN J.H REYNOLDS\n5 JUN 2020 • 6 MIN READ\nApps have revolutionized our entire lives and the way we conduct business. Never before has it been this easy to leverage the power of mobile and web technologies to further streamline business processes.\nThat’s why custom app development is something that businesses both big and small consider at some point. The possibilities are endless and with there being no shortage of development firms willing to do the job, there’s not even a need to hire an in-house development team.\nWhy your business might need a custom mobile app:\nIt’s this flexibility that has really pushed businesses to adopt mobile apps and technologies to improve their productivity and reduce costs. They don’t need to make significant investments in building up their own development teams and equipping them with the adequate resources.\nAll of this can put a strain on the finances of a business, particularly if it’s a startup, so most prefer to go the outsourcing route and trust a software company with the job. These companies are generally very experienced and can quickly get the project up and running. This enables the businesses to quickly deploy their custom apps and then scale up the project as and when required.\nYou might be wondering, what does my business stand to gain from a custom mobile app? You’ll be surprised to know that it actually stands to gain a fair bit.\nIt’s Tailored To Your Specific Needs\nYou may have struggled to find a one-size-fits-all software solution for your business. Even if you do find something that’s a little less than a perfect fit, it just won’t be able to help you achieve your goals. This is why custom mobile app development is so powerful.\nYou can work closely with the team of developers and outline exactly what you need the app to do. They can build it out to your exact specifications and the needs of your business. This will ensure that every dollar invested in the development of your app ends up improving your businesses processes.\nThat’s always better than paying for software that has features you’re never going to use. It’s this level of customization that will help drive efficiency and reduce costs in the long run.\nIt’s Scalable At Your Pace\nThink about it. You’d want the app that your business relies upon to scale up at the pace at which your business is growing. You don’t want to be paying for excess capacity or functionality that your business just doesn’t need at that particular stage, but needs to pay for it because the functionality that it does need comes bundled with the higher tier.\nThat’s how off-the-shelf solutions tend to lock in users and they eventually have to pay for scalability that they don’t need. A custom solution doesn’t have this issue since you can always ask the developers to bring up the app’s capabilities as per the needs of your business.\nThis is something that’s particularly beneficial for startup businesses as they tend to be strapped for cash. Anything that helps save money in the earlier stages of the business is absolutely necessary.\nProvide A Better Customer Experience\nSince you’ll have more control over the app experience, your business can provide a truly customized user experience through its app. That’s a very powerful tool when it comes to building up brand loyalty, and that helps with customer retention.\nCustomer retention is the key to success in any business as it’s more profitable to have repeat business from existing customers than going out and finding new ones. A custom app will help you achieve this goal.\nYou’ll Have More Control Over Security\nWhether it's customer data or business data that employees across your organizations access through the app, one can never be too safe when it comes to data security. A custom mobile app provides you with more control over the security aspect.\nYou’ll know exactly what security protocols and technologies have been utilized during the development stage. You can work with the team of developers to further jack it up if your business requires top notch data security.\nIt Creates A Direct Marketing Channel\nSince your custom app provides you with a direct link to your customers, it also opens up a direct marketing channel that costs you no money. You can continue to drive traffic to your business through methods like push notifications to keep your customers informed about sales and promotions.\nThis is a much more cost effective way to reach out to your existing customers instead of having to chase them around on the web with targeted ads, which can end up being very costly.\nIt Helps You Stand Out From The Competition\nCustomers want convenience and nothing can be more convenient for them than an app that lets them connect to your business with just a few taps. So your business automatically gets a perception boost before them compared to your competition that’s making the costly mistake of not reaching out to them through a custom app.\nIt Can Help Boost Productivity\nHave you grown tired of using off-the-shelf software solutions to try and boost productivity within the company? Perhaps these apps just don’t offer the kind of features that are in line with the needs of your business.\nThat’s where custom mobile apps really shine. They can be built from the ground up with your business objectives in mind. All of the functionality that you want your employees to take advantage of can be built into it, thus boosting productivity for all businesses processes.\nA Custom App Helps Boost Profits\nIncreased efficiency and productivity generally leads to a boost in profits. That’s something that every business strives to achieve. Leveraging a custom mobile app solution can really help boost profits. That, coupled with increased brand recognition and higher customer loyalty, can help drive more revenue and lead to more profits for the business.\nIntegration With Existing Software\nYou may already have custom software solutions deployed across your business that may not be compatible with an off-the-shelf solution. Even if it does, there could be integration issues that may cause unnecessary disruption to the business.\nA custom mobile app won’t suffer from those issues as it would have been developed with the express goal of properly integrating with existing software. This will reduce the chances of disruptions down the line.\nIt Allows For Enhanced Data Collection\nBusinesses thrive on data, the more targeted data that they can collect about their customers the more they can optimize their sales processes to generate more revenue. A custom mobile app will allow you to gather the right kind of data and then utilize that to improve your entire sales funnel.\nIt Provides Valuable Insights\nUsing the enhanced data collection with detailed analytics stats can help you form a better picture of how customers interact with your business. These insights can prove to be very valuable.\nFor example, you can easily see the times when most of your customers interact with your app, or when the push notifications you send tend to have the highest click-through rate. This data can prove to be very valuable in refining businesses processes to increase sales.\nFind an app development firm that can get your mobile app up and running quickly.\nYou might be wondering that now comes the hardest part: actually finding a software development firm that’s skilled enough to do the best job and create the mobile app of your dreams, one that’s going to help your business absolutely crush it.\nIt’s actually the easiest part!

    "extractedText": "BUSINESS\nUsability Testing\nIan J.H Reynolds\nExplore Ian J.H Reynolds' expertise in finance and economics through his insightful articles on market trends, investment strategies, and economic analysis.\nMore posts by Ian J.H Reynolds.\nIAN J.H REYNOLDS\n13 MAY 2020 • 6 MIN READ\nConsider this: You feel that you have the perfect idea for an app. You’ve done the research and found the gap in the market. All signs point to the app being a hit, a chart topper merely days after it’s published to app marketplaces. However, it doesn’t end up being that way, and chances are that you might have missed one crucial step.\nMarketing professionals have long used focus groups to test out their theories before spending millions of dollars on actual campaigns. You need to take a somewhat similar approach to your apps. It’s important to ensure that users can easily find their way around the app and that everything works before you pour resources into a full-scale launch.\nWhat is usability testing?\nThis is precisely what usability testing is for. It can be described fairly simply. Usability testing is the process by which it can be found out just how easy an app is to use. The process requires that the app be tested with real users, so that the feedback that's received is indicative of how general users might feel once it's released to the public.\nAs the word suggests, the core idea here is to measure just how \"usable\" the app really is. It has to be looked at from different angles. For example, is it easy for users to access all the features? Is it clear enough just what the app's capabilities are? Is the user experience intuitive? etc.\nUsability testing involves seeding the app or software to a select group of end users. They’re then observed as they put the product through its paces and if any usability defects are discovered, they're reported to the development team that can fix them before the full launch.\nWhat is it used for?\nThe primary purpose of usability testing is to figure out if any defects have been overlooked. It's carried out with a group of users that weren't involved in the testing before they're completely neutral to the product, in that they don't have any attachment of any kind with it. Thus the feedback that they provide can be entirely unbiased.\nSince they're real users, if they find some elements of the user experience confusing or face difficulties in extracting the most out of the app's features, the developers can quickly identify pain points that general users would face and take measures to address them.\nUsability testing can thus be used to understand if the software or app works as it's supposed to and users don't get \"lost\" or confused when using it, that it's all very functionally efficient and doesn't seem to have any bugs or issues.\nTypes of usability testing\nThere are several different types of usability testing and they can be utilized depending on what the end goal is. The insights gathered from testing can be used to design the user flows or the visual hierarchy that improves the overall user experience.\nComparative usability testing\nIn a comparative usability test, the end users are required to choose the best of two or more solutions. It’s primarily carried out to check the effectiveness of a product against that of its competitors, to find out if there are any shortcomings and then addressing them if need be.\nFor an app, this would involve comparing the different user interfaces with each other, and observing metrics such as error rates, task completion and time spent on each task. Generally, participants in a comparative usability test would provide more useful feedback. They see two or more ways of doing the same thing which makes it easier for them to compare between the two, as opposed to having just a singular experience.\nExplorative usability testing\nExplorative usability testing is more open-ended. Unlike comparative testing, participants are encouraged to think aloud. They are asked to give their opinions and explain just how they feel about a particular design or user flow.\nThis is generally carried out during the initial stages of development in order to judge how end users might react to the design. Getting these results early on in the development stage helps create a fully informed process with the exact needs of your target audience in mind.\nThe feedback it can surface includes what expectations the users might develop from the product, if they're able to distinguish between different elements and features, and if they can appreciate the inherent value of the software or app's functionality.\nUsability evaluations\nWhether it's an app or software, it needs to be genuinely useful for its audience, otherwise the project won't turn out to be a success. That's why the purpose of usability evaluation is best described as a measure of the product's ability to be useful to the people that are going to be using it.\nThe entire focus of this exercise is to figure out just how well the users can use the app to do what they want to do with it. It's also a measure of their satisfaction with the process of achieving those goals. Ultimately, usability evaluations can help you figure out whether or not the app will be worth it for its target market.\nPros to Usability Testing\nUsability testing can save you a lot of time and money. The insights that the users provide can be used to make changes that improve the end result. Without it, you could end up launching an app that’s not intuitive at all and is not functionally robust either.\nPeople who are closely involved with the development of a product can often overlook pain points that the average user might experience, largely because of their advanced knowledge of the product. Usability testing offers that \"fresh pair of eyes\" perspective and helps you get an unbiased view of your product.\nIf you want your software and app to be successful, you'd want it to meet the expectations of its users. Testing its usability will ensure that all of the features and functions work just as they were intended to do. This way, when customers buy it, they don't feel that they paid for something that over-promised and under-delivered.\nCons to Usability Testing\nIf you outsource the job to an inexperienced service provider, chances are that the audience they end up selecting for the usability testing of your product isn't suited to it at all. If they have not used similar products in the past or are just not interested in what your product offers, then any data taken from those tests would likely not be useful.\nUsability testing is much more than filling a room with people and handing out smartphones with your app on it. Depending on just how accurate you want the data to be, you may be required to pay for costly specialized equipment. This is normally done for measuring really precise data points like eye movement, frustration and engagement levels, etc.\nThere could also be confidentiality issues. You're essentially sharing an idea that you spent months developing with a group of strangers. There's no stopping anyone from simply ripping it off, or leaking information to your competitors even if strict controls are placed during the test. They can always memorize something and reveal it later on.\nTake advantage of usability testing in your custom app development.\nThe advantages of usability testing outweigh any potential drawbacks, be it from a confidentiality or a cost standpoint. That’s why it still remains a highly important process to this day, with companies investing significant amounts of time and resources into usability testing of their products.\nThe team at Zibtek has been designing great mobile apps for more than a decade. They've handled all sorts of projects from ERP-integrated mobile experiences to education apps and even mobile games. Their developers are proficient in iOS, Android, React native, Phonegap and hybrid development, and are very well equipped to handle the entire project lifecycle.\nNot only do they help with the development process, they can also deploy the app to the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, in addition to providing support and maintenance services after the app has been released.\nThey have long been a trusted service provider for Fortune 500s and startups alike.

Chances are you can -- and so can the rest of your team -- but it may not be the most efficient use of your time. That’s why object recognition software can be a time-saver for many businesses.\nIt can also provide more functionality for your end users, particularly if you’re building an app that relies on image categorization and content management.\nWhat is object recognition?\nIn its simplest form, object recognition refers to the ability of a software program (usually AI software) to identify and distinguish between specific objects in a picture or video.\nIf you’ve ever used Google Lens, or wondered how Google Photos manages to sort all of your photos into categories (such as images featuring “mountains” or “bridges”) then you’re already familiar with object recognition.\nFrom identifying books based on their cover, to more advanced uses such as identifying plants in the wild, object recognition technology has come a long way.\nBut many businesses still don’t understand how object recognition works, or may think that it’s only available to major software companies with deep pockets.\nIn fact, object recognition is becoming more prevalent by the day, with tools that even small and mid-sized businesses can incorporate into their software.\nThese tools can be used to identify each instance of an object in a particular photoset -- known as object detection -- or multiple objects within a single image.\nAlthough facial recognition is technically a type of object recognition, it’s typically treated separately due to its additional complexity and legal concerns.\nHow does object recognition work?\nSo, how exactly does object recognition software work? The first thing to keep in mind is the difference between object detection and object recognition.\nObject detection is used to locate an object -- for example, to show you where an object is in a given image -- while object recognition is used to identify an object.\nObject recognition can be used to sort objects into general classes, such as an animal or an inanimate object, or more specific categories, such as dog or cat.\nIn some cases, object recognition can be done without AI technology, by using template matching, in which a part of an image is matched to a template, or image segmentation, in which a complex image is partitioned into more easily recognizable components.\nThe success of the software depends on many factors, including the image quality, how many images are included in the set, and how accurate the results need to be. A shop that wants to identify misplaced inventory may be able to handle a greater margin of error than a self-driving car that needs to identify obstacles in the road.\nMore advanced object recognition can be done with one of two approaches: machine learning and deep learning, both of which have their pros and cons.\nMachine Learning\nMachine learning can be best described as training your software to perform a particular activity -- in this case, recognizing objects in a photo.\nThis is done by providing the software with a set of images and a list of distinguishing features that it can use to recognize an object.\nFor example, you might train a machine learning algorithm to analyze an object’s color, shape, or size, in order to identify its unique characteristics.\nOne of the main benefits to machine learning is that it doesn’t require a large dataset or computing power, reducing the cost of the software.\nThe main disadvantage is that it takes more effort to set up and requires more oversight from your team. If you only have a limited number of photos to include in your training set, then your algorithm may struggle if it’s applied to a broader set of images.\nMachine learning has a high level of accuracy, as long as it sticks to its comfort zone and has been trained to recognize the most salient features of a given object.\nDeep Learning\nDeep learning is a more versatile approach, but it requires a larger data set, substantial hardware, and more computational power.\nIn this approach, the software essentially trains itself using an artificial neural network, which is modeled after the neurons in a human brain.\nInstead of handpicking the features that you want your software to recognize, it learns to identify them itself based on the dataset you provide.\nFor example, you might provide it with a large dataset of images, of which some do and some don’t contain the object in question.\nUnlike machine learning, which requires you to identify the differences between objects, deep learning algorithms can devise their own set of rules.\nThe images simply need to be labeled as containing a “dog” or “no dog,” and you don’t need to train the software on the specific features that distinguish a dog.\nThe downside to this approach is that it requires a massive dataset -- often millions of images -- which smaller companies may not have access to.\nIf you do have the hardware and computational power to spare, however, deep learning can attain a high degree of success and can be applied to many situations.\nAdditionally, the software can determine its own confidence level in a prediction, letting you know whether it is 100% certain or 95% certain that a given object is a dog.\nWhy would you need object recognition software?\nNow that we’ve looked at some of the technology that goes into object recognition, what are some common use cases in various industries?\nAnd why use this kind of software in the first place, when human employees don’t need training in order to identify the objects they work with every day?\nIn short, object recognition software can save you time. Humans simply can’t sort and analyze images at the speed that a well-trained algorithm can.\nAdditionally, software can see things that humans can’t. Your industry might use optical representations of sound waves, for example, or look for anomalies in medical images that are hard to process with the human eye.\nFinally, object recognition software can detect patterns. While a person might get tired of looking at the same types of images over and over, your software won’t, and can view more images in a year than a human can view over their entire lifetime.\nWith the right combination of deep learning and human guidance, object recognition can provide new services that weren’t available just a few years ago.\nHere are a few use cases for object recognition software:\nContent Management\nAre you a media or publishing company with a huge set of images? You can use object recognition to sort your content, filter out unwanted content (such as explicit material), and search for images based on what’s actually in the picture.\nThis can cut down on miscategorization, and having to manually search for photos that were sorted using an outdated content management system.\nRetail and manufacturing\nOnline stores such as Amazon know exactly what they have in stock at any given time, but physical retail stores have historically had to take inventory manually.\nWith object recognition, these stores can have access to a similar level of information, using software to monitor what’s on the shelves in real-time.\nLikewise, object recognition can be used on the factory floor to track inventory, handle quality control, and perform other tasks that rely on visual analysis.\nHealth care\nOne of the most publicized uses for object recognition is in healthcare, where AI tools are reportedly better than doctors at some kinds of cancer detection. The technology helped reduce both false negatives and false positions, and could be used to give a “second opinion,” rather than replace a human radiologist altogether.\nTransport\nAnd of course, object recognition plays a major role in transportation and logistics. Any kind of driverless car or semi-autonomous vehicle would be impossible without it.\nFrom recognizing traffic lights to identifying pedestrians, this kind of software needs to be able to detect objects not just in photos, but in real-time video feeds.\nWhere to find pre-trained models\nIncorporating object recognition into your software doesn’t mean starting from scratch. If you don’t have access to the datasets or computing power you need, you can use tools that already exist, such as the TensorFlow Object Detection API from Google.\nApple also offers a machine learning API called Core ML, which can be used to run an object recognition model on an iOS device or in the cloud.\nOther third-parties offer Machine Learning as a Service, which means you can choose from pre-trained models designed to perform specific tasks.\nWhile these kinds of tools are less powerful than custom-built models, they don’t need to be maintained in-house and can be run on the cloud or on a smartphone.\nHire the right professionals to develop your software\nMachine learning can be hard to wrap your head around, especially if your team doesn’t have prior experience with artificial intelligence. That’s why it’s important to find the right software developers for your project. The team at Zibtek has experience working with a variety of object recognition tools, including custom-built and third-party APIs. Whether you’re building an object recognition tool from scratch, or using a pre-trained model, Zibtek can help you find the best solution for your business needs today. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

    "extractedText": "WEB DEVELOPMENT\nWebsite Development Services\nIan J.H Reynolds\nExplore Ian J.H Reynolds' expertise in finance and economics through his insightful articles on market trends, investment strategies, and economic analysis.\nMore posts by Ian J.H Reynolds.\nIAN J.H REYNOLDS\n6 APR 2020 • 6 MIN READ\nBut this approach leaves little opportunity for features, such as a membership portal or e-commerce platform, that can make your website more engaging.\nThese days, even brick-and-mortar businesses recognize the importance of a website with an up-to-date blog, social media integrations, analytical tools, and more.\nWhat is modern web development?\nSo, what makes modern web development services different from earlier approaches? One of the major differences is that the process can be more continuous, and integrated with other parts of your business, rather than a standalone project.\nFor example, instead of hiring a developer to create a static website, and then having to re-hire them every time you want to update it or something breaks down, your team can be continuously updating the website based on analytics and user feedback.\nIt’s much easier to add and subtract components as you go, rather than having to start from scratch every time you change something in your business.\nEven less tech-savvy businesses can install new tools, such as chatbots and callback widgets, without having to worry about breaking anything.\nAnother difference is that more developers are becoming full stack developers, which means that they can handle both the front- and back-end of your site.\nOld-school web development approaches relied on specialists to develop each piece of the website. For example, a front-end developer would focus on the parts of the site that the user interacts with, while a back-end developer would handle the internal elements, such as a content management system.\nFull stack developers take a more holistic approach, and can oversee your project from start to finish. They typically specialize in one or more programming languages, such as Ruby or Python, and may have additional visual and web design skills.\nOne more thing to keep in mind is the rise of the API, or application program interface, which is essentially a language or protocol by which the components of your software can interact with each other or with components of publicly available software.\nFor example, the Google Maps API allows you to embed maps onto your own website, while the YouTube Analytics API allows you to track data about your video views.\nYou can also use a private API to make some of your data available to external vendors or other partners who need access to something in your database.\nAll of these changes mean that website development services are more flexible and can be customized to suit nearly any business.\nBut they also add a degree of complexity to the process, and mean it’s more important than ever to choose developers who can work with you closely from start to finish.\nTypes of web development services\nNow, let’s take a look at some specific web development services that you might choose to incorporate into your project.\nWebsites\nThe simplest web development option is a website. This can consist of one or more web pages, as well as multimedia content, that a user can navigate through.\nWebsites can either be static or dynamic. Static websites deliver the same content to every user, and require manual updates, while dynamic websites offer some degree of interactivity, and may load differently based on the activity stored in browser cookies.\nA dynamic website might show a different list of products or blog posts to each user, for example, depending on their previous clicks or search requests.\nMany websites attract visitors using SEO (search engine optimization), which refers to the practice of using keywords that customers are searching for.\nWebsites are useful for generating traffic and providing information, but their features are limited compared to other web development options.\nWeb applications\nThe next step up is to turn your web site into a web application. While the distinction is blurry, the main difference comes down to how interactive your website is. A site with a high degree of interactivity is called an application.\nFor example, a static page that displays a restaurant’s address and menu is considered a website. But a website that includes tools for making reservations or ordering takeout could be considered a web application.\nOther common types of web applications include email and online banking platforms.\nWeb apps are similar to websites in that they’re accessed through a browser, but they don’t typically display distinct URLs for each page that you visit.\nInstead of loading a new web page with each click, a single-page application rewrites the existing page with new information from the server. This makes the website faster and more “app-like,” even if the user experience is relatively similar.\nAnother major benefit to web applications is that they can be easily integrated with other software. For example, your e-commerce application could automatically input customer data into your company’s ERP or CRM more easily than a traditional website.\nMobile apps\nWeb applications are not to be confused with mobile apps, which are designed for use on smartphones, and can take the form of native apps or in-browser web apps.\nModern web development services can create a variety of mobile apps, from field force automation apps that your sales reps can use on-the-go, to booking and ticketing apps that your customers can use to make purchases or reservations.\nUnlike traditional websites, which may show up differently depending on which browser or operating system you use, mobile web development uses responsive design to make sure that your pages load properly, no matter which device a customer is on.\nThis can help you provide a consistent brand experience across platforms, create more opportunities for in-house collaboration, or offer services that your website doesn’t.\nWhether or not you need a mobile app depends on what services you offer and where your users are located when they access your site. Travel-oriented brands may benefit from an app that customers can use in the car or on the go.\nMobile apps can also be configured for offline use. This is especially important if your users are likely to access them on a plane or on a subway.\nThese apps download enough data -- such as map data or playable media -- that they remain usable even when you lose connectivity.\nWeb portals\nNext, there are web portals, which differ from standard websites in that they provide a more personalized access point, either for at-home customers or in-house users.\nFor example, a web portal could include anything from an e-commerce storefront to an e-learning platform used for remote lessons or employee training.\nOther uses for web portals include B2B portals for vendors, bulletin boards and forums, and self-care portals that allow customers to manage account settings from afar.\nWhat makes portals so useful is that they’re tailored to each individual user of the site, and access can be restricted to only those users who have the appropriate account.\nInstead of every visitor to your website seeing the same set of products, for example, they can view their purchase history and see products recommended for them.\nWhen it comes to employee training, a portal can allow you to track which steps each employee has completed, or provide specific resources for their department.\nWeb portals are typically referred to as being horizontal or vertical.\nVertical portals are narrowly focused on a specific industry. For example, a real estate portal might provide resources tailored to home-buyers or real estate agents.\nA horizontal portal is more wide-ranging, and can cater to many different types of users and demographics. Many news websites, such as Yahoo! News, are horizontal portals, because they serve as an access point for a wide range of content.\nWeb portals can have direct business applications, such as an enterprise web portal, or it can simply be used to provide a more personalized experience for customers.\nPublic web services\nFinally, there are public web services, which use an open API to connect your server to external applications. This kind of web development is most useful for large companies that have relationships with multiple partners.\nFor example, let’s say you’re an e-commerce platform that has a referral program with dozens of affiliates. Without an API, these affiliates could refer customers to your web store, but wouldn’t have access to real-time data on your products.\nWith an API, they could use a widget to display which of your products are in stock and what the current prices and shipping times are.\nYour web developer can make sure that your data is secure by setting up authentication methods to ensure that only the right partners have access to this data.\nHire a professional website developer for your project\nModern web development services have come a long way, and keeping track of all of your options -- and knowing which ones are right for your business -- can seem like a full-time job. That’s why it’s important to hire professional web developers who can do the job right and help you choose from among all the available options.Whether you need a full stack developer, or just want to create a single-page app, reach out to the team at Zibtek to get started on your new web development project today!

The more team members that you have working on a project, the more important it is to have strategies in place to ensure that everyone is on the same page and working together -- instead of getting in each other’s way.\nThat’s what DevOps is all about. DevOps is an approach to software development that focuses on collaboration between the development and operations teams -- teams that aren’t traditionally used to working together.\nWith that in mind, let’s take a look at what DevOps is, how it can benefit your business, and whether it makes sense for you to outsource it.\nWhat is DevOps?\nDevOps is a software development approach that improves the communication between those who develop the software, and those who do the operations – which refers to the actual installation and maintenance of the software, and the infrastructure it runs on.\nThis results in less back-and-forth between your dev team and your ops team, since it breaks down the siloed structure of traditional software development methods. DevOps helps both groups work together towards a shared goal, rather than working at odds with each other and stepping on each other’s toes. This allows for faster and more seamless development, and a less error-prone software development life cycle.\nWhy has there traditionally been tension between developers and operators? In large part, that’s because developers want to build new features as quickly as possible, but then pass the results on to the operators, whose job it is to install the new build.\nOperators want to deploy the build as slowly as possible to ensure that it works reliably and isn’t going to wake them up in the middle of the night with a system crash.\nA DevOps approach integrates dev and ops roles in an effort to improve communication between teams and catch potential issues long before they become critical.\nDevOps vs Traditional IT\nAs software companies grow, they need to maintain the systems on which their software runs to ensure that they can deliver a positive experience to their customers. They may hire one or more systems administrators to manage this part of the SDLC.\nThis may work out well at first, but companies often find that developers do things that make the operations job more difficult, and vice-versa.\nFor example, a developer might write code that that causes the software to crash. When the ops team deploys this software, they may see that it crashes for no obvious reason, and simply restart it. Since they aren’t developers themselves, they may not understand the code they’re working with, and don’t fix it. They find that they can avoid a crash by restarting the software daily, so they stop worrying about it.\nOn the other hand, a developer might test their software on their own machine, but then have it fail in production because of security measures that the operations team has put in place. The developer may complain to the operations team that they’re breaking their software, resulting in a discussion about why those security measures are in place, and what could be done to work within the defined security constraints.\nIn short, in many traditional software development life cycles, developers throw software over to the ops teams, who deploy it as best they can, but due to poor communication, each team develops a frustration with the other’s approach to their respective jobs.\nThe DevOps Approach\nDevOps addresses this concern by more tightly integrating the two teams, allowing the ops team to give developers direct access to the production deployment environment so they can debug and fix their own production issues, and liaise with the operations team on best practices for the operations side of things.\nTeams are more likely to develop a rapport with each other, work together, and reduce the turn-around time on issues that might hold up software deployments.\nSome teams take an agile approach to software development, but leave the deployment and other operations components out of this process, and these parts of the system end up using an outdated waterfall model. DevOps applies this agile technique to ops as well as dev, keeping both included within the same process.\nAfter some planning, a typical DevOps life cycle might look like this:\nDevelop\nDevelopers still write the code, but because it takes less time to get the code into the production environment, they can write the code in smaller chunks, resulting in more manageable changes that are easier to debug.\nTest\nThe QA team tests each feature using automated tests that have been written to ensure that each feature works in isolation, and that any features that fail tests can be efficiently passed back to developers for review and debugging.\nIntegrate\nDevelopers check that each feature integrates smoothly with the larger system and that interactions between features don’t cause unexpected behaviour. Much of this can be done with more comprehensive integration testing tools.\nDeploy\nOnce all of the tests have been run, each feature that has passed can be deployed to production. Often the test suite being used can automatically deploy to production any features that have passed all tests.\nMonitor\nAppropriate monitoring is put in place to ensure that production systems remain running efficiently. Any issues that arise in production should result in an automated notification being sent to those responsible for the features in question so they can debug them, update any inadequate tests, and re-deploy them.\nWhat Is DevOps as a Service?\nSo how does DevOps as a Service (DaaS) differ from regular DevOps? Simply, DaaS is a suite of managed cloud-based tools that form a pipeline to facilitate all components of DevOps. This might include tools for code tracking and review, automated unit testing, issue/bug tracking, automated deployment, and a monitoring system.\nPutting together DevOps infrastructure from scratch can be a lot of painstaking work, so finding an off-the-shelf solution is an alternative to re-inventing the wheel.\nAdvantages of DaaS\nDaaS has a lot of advantages. Because it’s cloud-based, team members can work from almost anywhere. There’s less internal company infrastructure to be maintained for your development and testing systems, since this is outsourced to the cloud provider.\nDue to the nature of cloud services, it’s easy to acquire computing power as necessary to run tests and deployments, and then give up access to this power when it’s no longer needed. This can result in significant cost savings when compared to having in-house servers running 24/7, even when they aren’t doing anything important.\nThis cloud infrastructure is managed by experienced DevOps engineers, so you’ll have plenty of support if any issues arise with your deployment pipeline. Plus, they can help your in-house IT department learn how to use and maintain these new tools.\nDisadvantages of DaaS\nDaaS is a great approach for many teams, but like any software development process, it isn’t perfect. In order to make the most effective use of DaaS, your software team will need a certain degree of software development experience, to ensure they can make appropriate use of the testing, debugging, deployment, and monitoring tools.\nIf your dev team is used to writing code and then leaving the build (and any problems associated with it) in the hands of the operations team, they’ll have a hard time getting up to speed with DaaS and may need a bit of training to be able to work with it.\nFurthermore, DevOps often prioritises speed of development over security. Given that DaaS makes heavy use of cloud-based services, security is a factor you may need to consider carefully. You can always ask your DevOps team to increase the priority of security for your situation though, if it is necessary.\nIs DevOps Right For Your Business?\nIn general, DevOps offers faster delivery of software while still maintaining reliability, so for many businesses, it can be a useful approach. If your organization is relatively small and you’ve just switched from an offline system to a more automatic technology-based approach to running your business, it may not be worthwhile to invest in learning and implementing a full DevOps approach just yet.\nStill, keeping a DevOps approach in mind as you develop your software, and using bits and pieces of the methodology as you go, could put you in a far better position to fully embrace devops in the future if you grow to the point that it becomes practical.\nChoose a professional DevOps team to do it right\nTransitioning to a DevOps approach to software development can be a big step for any company. Whether you currently manage your IT in-house or you outsource most of it, be sure to choose experienced DevOps professionals when you make the switch to a more DevOps-focused development model.\nThe team at Zibtek has experience with web and mobile development, QA automation, continuous deployment, and more.

They feature a database that can be accessed by multiple departments (such as sales and accounting), and are used to track everything from online purchases to payroll to inventory.\nBecause businesses in different industries have unique requirements, ERP software is rarely “one-size-fits-all,” and it’s important to use a platform that’s built for your industry. In this article, we’ll look at ERP software that’s designed for the construction industry, including examples of five ERP platforms that you can use for your business.\nWhat is construction ERP software?\nFirst, why is it so important to use an ERP platform that’s specialized for you? Partly, so that you’ll be able to accurately reflect all of your business activities.\nThe main purpose of ERP software is to help you see the big picture and how all of the parts of your business fit together. ERPs can help you automate recurring tasks, reduce friction between departments, and streamline your workflows.\nWith a generic ERP, you may have some of the components you need for your industry, such as inventory management and human resources management, but not all.\nWith construction ERP software, you’ll have additional tools that you can use to manage contractors and subcontractors, track purchase orders, receive bids, and more.\nConstruction ERPs can help you plan ahead, creating accurate budgets and timelines for your projects so you can purchase the raw materials you’ll need.\nManagers can delegate tasks and view time sheets, even if their teams are distributed across multiple work sites or projects.\nAnd, you can use your ERP to exchange information directly with clients and vendors, granting them access only to the data they need.\nEven within the construction industry, though, different types of businesses may have their own set of requirements in an ERP. For example, a general contractor will have a different organizational structure and workflow than a developer.\nThat’s why it’s so important to understand how the different modules fit together, and which ones are most relevant for your team.\nThe following ERP modules are especially useful for construction companies:\nMost construction ERPs will have a range of modules, including core features that come standard with the software, and additional options for more niche uses.\nInventory modules offer tools for tracking equipment, monitoring costs, calculating the materials used, and more. For example, you could use a wireless management system (WMS) to track the movement of equipment using a handheld scanner.\nLogistics modules handle shipping and tracking, route management, sales orders, and other operational tasks. This might include loading up a truck, determining an efficient route and shipping schedule, and monitoring its progress to the destination.\nProject management modules are used to get your projects completed on time, with tools for shop floor routing, waste management, subcontracting, and more.\nSupply chain management modules cover procurement, purchase orders, point of sale transactions, sales order labels, and supplier relationship management.\nWorkforce modules deal with scheduling, time tracking, and task management.\nOther modules, such as accounting and customer relationship management, are used in many industries, but can also be incorporated into your construction ERP.\nThe key to a successful ERP design is that everything is connected to a central database. If your teams have to log into multiple applications to do their job, then that defeats the purpose of having a centralized data repository.\nA unified ERP design, in which data can be easily shared between departments, cuts down on data silos and reduces the complexity of day-to-day operations.\nHere are five construction ERP software programs you should consider.\nIf you’re looking for an off-the-shelf ERP that’s designed specifically for the construction industry, these 5 ERPs are considered some of the best on the market.\nBut keep in mind that off-the-shelf ERPs, no matter how industry-specific, may still have limitations on how they can be customized and which modules are included.\nSage\nSage 300 is designed for use in the construction and real estate industries, with a focus on end-to-end construction and property investment.\nThe software is best for medium to large businesses with an interest in:\nProperty management\nJob cost tracking\nEstimating compliance\nAnd more\nSage 300 offers mobile and cloud-based tools, such as document management, that your team members can access from their desks or on the construction site.\nThey also offer a product called Sage 110 Contractor, which is designed for smaller construction firms and can take the place of accounting tools like QuickBooks. For example, you can track overtime hours, unexpected material costs, and more.\nOther features include Sage Service Operations, a customer service module that can be integrated with Sage 100 and 300 to improve communications with clients. There’s also ToolOps, which helps you avoid losing your tools by keeping track of them in the cloud, and ensuring that your teams have access to the gear they need on-site.\nEpicor\nEpicor is one of the most customizable off-the-shelf construction ERPs, with the option to install it locally and host it on your own machines, or deploy it to the cloud.\nWhile more and more ERPs offer cloud deployment, that wasn’t always the case, and many legacy ERPs still require the customer to invest in physical infrastructure.\nThe benefit to hosting your ERP in the cloud is that your ERP vendor will be responsible for maintenance and security.\nCloud connectivity also ensures that you’ll be able to access your database in a wider range of cases, including on mobile devices and IoT (Internet of Things) devices.\nYou can also stay connected with your global workforce, with country-specific features that help you comply with regulations no matter where in the world you are.\nWith Epicor, you’ll also have the option of adding on additional modules, such as CRM or PLM, to further integrate your business operations across teams.\nMaestro\nMaestro is a Canadian company that offers construction ERP software with a focus on accounting and project management. It’s designed for heavy and civil contractors, trade contractors, service contractors, and more.\nAs with many new ERP platforms, it’s cloud-based, allowing your distributed team to access a “virtual office” any time they need to.\nMaestro can handle everything from supply chain management to payroll, with built-in tools to monitor union rates and time sheets.\nTheir accounting tools use construction-specific cost codes, so you don’t have to keep track of your expenses using generalized accounting terms.\nYou’ll start off by choosing your core modules, then add on additional modules to meet more specific needs, such as dispatching and inventory management.\nPenta\nPenta is one of the oldest construction ERPs around, with over 35 years of experience building software for contractors. Of course, it offers plenty of updates to keep up with the pace of modern construction software and mobile devices.\nPenta can handle payroll, accounting, project management, and more. It also has tools for business intelligence, including customized reporting and OLAP analytics.\nYou can use Penta for mobile field inspections, such as managing the inspection tasks in your work orders, creating question sets, and logging deficiencies.\nPenta offers both a customer portal and an employee self-service portal, so you can cut down on postage and paperwork. Deliver online pay statements and company news to your employees, and share documents with customers using the same ERP.\nPenta can be used by concrete contractors, industrial contractors, electrical and utility contractors, and more, with customizations available for specific niches.\nMicrosoft Dynamics SL\nDynamics SL is an ERP produced by Microsoft that is not specifically designed for the construction industry, but for any project-based business.\nStill, many construction companies use it because of its versatility, with tools for project costing and materials management that are suitable for contractors of all kinds.\nPrices vary depending on the number of users, and whether you deploy the software in-house or to the cloud. You can also add on modules from Microsoft’s suite of tools, making it a good choice for teams that have their hands in a variety of sectors, from private industry to government contractors.\nDynamics SL is built for collaboration, with role-specific access so you can share data with clients, or grant Light User access without paying the full user subscription fee.\nOr you can build your own.\nIn some cases, none of the existing software options are just right. Maybe you work in a very specific niche in the construction industry, and you want an ERP that’s built to your specifications. Or maybe you just want one with more engaging UX design.\nIn the end, it may be more cost-effective to build an ERP than to pay a subscription fee to a SaaS platform, especially if you add more users as your company scales.\nWhatever your requirements, the team at Zibtek can develop a custom ERP solution for your business. Zibtek can either design a new ERP from scratch, with all of the modules you need, or upgrade your legacy ERP into a shiny new user-friendly model.\nEither way, you’ll end up with a customized platform that helps you track and streamline your business operations and boost your ROI.

From streaming movies and music, to IoT (Internet of Things) devices, it seems like more and more apps are making use of their connection to the cloud.\nBut there’s one area in which working in the cloud is not yet the norm, and that’s when it comes to app development. This can get a little technical, so bear with us as we explain the difference between cloud apps and traditional apps.\nCloud apps vs. traditional apps\nEssentially, the difference between a cloud app and a traditional app is the architecture, which refers to the systems and structures that comprise a piece of software.\nTraditional apps are more rigid, with three main tiers: a logic tier, a presentation tier, and a database tier, all hosted on their own individual server. Because the app infrastructure is static, it’s harder to scale. This remains the case even when the app is subsequently moved to a virtual server. If any of the infrastructure fails, it all fails.\nIn short, traditional apps may be cloud-ready, but they aren’t designed to be used on the cloud. This includes many legacy apps, which can be deployed to the cloud using a VM (virtual machine), but use network-based storage and computational power. As a result, they cost more to maintain and don’t really benefit from being moved to the cloud.\nCloud apps, on the other hand, are deployed in the cloud from the start, so they’re less dependent on physical infrastructure. They’re much more versatile, and are usually built using service-oriented architecture (SOA). This means that data can be delivered using individual components and can be organized based on usage and other factors.\nCloud providers offer many of the managed services that cloud aps require to operate, such as database servers, eliminating the need to run the app on a VM. This makes it easier to scale and maintain them, with less likelihood of failure.\nNative cloud apps are even more flexible, allowing for greater scalability and continuous deployment. They’re built entirely in the cloud, with Containers as a Service (CaaS) and Functions as a Service (Faas) making up the bulk of their architecture.\nThese apps are more modular, and can incorporate user and developer feedback more easily. They can either be hosted on a public cloud, such as AWS, or on a private cloud, which is an option for businesses that already have a secure internal data center.\nUltimately, you can think of the cloud as a spectrum that includes traditional apps, apps that are designed to be run on the cloud, and apps that are built entirely in the cloud. As more developers move toward cloud app development, it’s becoming the go-to solution for companies that want to build modern, scalable apps from the very beginning.\nHow are the development processes different?\nBecause cloud apps have a different architecture and deployment process, they require a different set of skills on your development team. Usually, cloud apps are built using a DevOps process that includes a high degree of collaboration and user feedback. They may use agile methodology or a modified version of the waterfall model.\nBecause cloud apps are built using containers and microservices, they can be deployed and updated on a shorter time frame. Unlike traditional apps, which require an integrated set of services in order to function, individual microservices perform their own functions, and communicate with each other using APIs and a service mesh layer.\nThey may also rely on serverless architecture, which means your developers don’t have to spend as much time on infrastructure, and can prioritize the code. You can either build a cloud-native app from scratch, or turn your legacy app into a cloud-ready version.\nEither way, the unique features of cloud app development means that you can be more involved in the process than you would be with a traditional app.\nCloud app development requires risk.\nThat said, cloud app development isn’t without risk. Here are a few of the questions to keep in mind when speaking with your developer about the development process:\nHow scalable is it?\nTraditional apps rely on your company’s internal servers and data centers, which can mean a single point of failure if anything goes wrong. Cloud apps, on the other hand, rely on your cloud service provider, which raises concerns of its own. Can they meet your app’s data load if you receive a sudden increase in traffic?\nOne solution is to choose a hybrid cloud strategy, which means that your workload is distributed across a combination of public and private servers. That way, it’s easier to keep pace with your users’ demands and scale up or down as necessary.\nHow secure is it?\nBecause cloud apps are communicating with a range of services through their API, they can be susceptible to data breaches and other cyberthreats. One benefit to cloud apps is that the distribution of their components reduces the risk of brute force attacks that could more easily take down a single enterprise server.\nStill, it’s important to talk with your developer about security measures, such as using SSL, proxy servers, and data encryption to protect yourself and your users.\nHow portable is it?\nIdeally, your app should prioritize portability and interoperability, and be able to run in multiple cloud environments. This means that if you want to switch between AWS to Azure, your app will be capable of making the move without having to be rebuilt.\nNot all apps and as portable as others, so speak with your development team to make sure that they’re using standardized protocols and containers.\nCloud app development increases interactivity between customers and partners.\nApp development used to be a tedious and time-consuming process. From R&D to unit and usability testing, development took place in discrete phases, with each step coming after the next. This made it harder for the development team to adapt to changes in the customer’s needs or to feedback from users.\nBut with the rise of DevOps and agile development methods, interactivity between the development team, the customer, and other partners is easier than ever.\nBecause questions about infrastructure are secondary, developers can focus on writing the code, making changes more quickly and incorporating user feedback.\nAdditionally, because everything from data storage to testing takes place in the cloud, customers can view changes to individual containers more quickly, without waiting for the entire app to be redeveloped and redeployed.\nCustomers can also share their apps with third parties, enabling their external partners to have access to certain systems. With this increased interactivity, though, comes the security concerns associated with sharing data.\nCompanies without much cloud computing experience may not realize just how much access they’re granting to third parties.\nBut with continuous deployment and frequent testing routines, you can ensure that your security and accessibility practices are in line with your company’s current needs.\nKeep an eye out on the constant resource requirements of cloud apps.\nWith the increased modularity and scalability of cloud apps comes additional resource requirements. For one, cloud apps may simply have a greater number of components for your development team to keep track of.\nFrom one or more cloud servers to hundreds or even thousands of microservices, the individual components may not be as visible if you don’t know where to look.\nYour vendors may use different tools and systems than those you currently use on your enterprise system, making it harder to see how it all fits together.\nAnd, finally, you may have to do some extra work to track your usage of cloud services. Since fees are often based on usage, your costs may rise and fall based on how much data or bandwidth your app is using.\nHave you set up an automated testing routine on your app and forgot to turn it off? You may be paying fees that you wouldn’t be paying if the same thing happened on one of your internal servers. After all, you might be paying for rent and power usage on your own machines, but a virtual machine on the cloud comes with a different fee scale.\nWith the increasing awareness of the energy resources that cloud computing requires, it may be worth doing some research into which platforms have the most efficient cloud to ensure that your cloud app costs less to run and has a lower carbon footprint.\nGet a cloud app developer that can solve these problems for you.\nThere are a lot of factors that go into developing a cloud app, but the benefits to cloud apps over traditional apps are clearer than ever. If you’re looking for a flexible, scalable solution to your business needs, then cloud app development may be the way to go.\nOnce you’ve made that decision, it’s time to choose a developer who can answer your questions and solve any problems that arise along the way. The team at Zibtek has years of experience developing web apps, mobile apps, cloud apps, and more. Whether you’re building a new app from the ground up, or rebuilding your legacy app to be redeployed on the cloud, reach out to Zibtek to find out how we can help you develop your custom cloud-based app today!

    "extractedText": "APP DEVELOPMENT\nWhat is Xamarin?\nIan J.H Reynolds\nExplore Ian J.H Reynolds' expertise in finance and economics through his insightful articles on market trends, investment strategies, and economic analysis.\nMore posts by Ian J.H Reynolds.\nIAN J.H REYNOLDS\n17 MAR 2020 • 7 MIN READ\nMore and more small and mid-sized businesses are turning to mobile apps as a way to connect with customers or perform in-house sales activities. Whether you’re developing a location-based app for your field sales team, or a loyalty app for customers, apps can offer a branded, user-friendly experience for your employees and customers alike.\nBut developing your own native apps takes time, especially if you have more than one app to build. With Xamarin, you can use your existing C# skills to build apps that share up to 90% of your code between platforms, saving you time and money.\nEssentially, Xamarin apps act and appear like native apps, but are built using a single language, or make use of code that you’ve already written for other apps.\nWhat is Xamarin?\nXamarin is an open-source platform that developers can use to build apps for Android, iOS, and Windows devices. In technical terms, it’s “an abstraction layer that manages communication of shared code with underlying platform code.”\nThat means your app will function similarly on any platform, by pairing the underlying SDKs and APIs with a layer of platform-specific code.\nXamarim was bought by Microsoft in 2016, and is included in Visual Studio, making it free to use for individual developers, or as part of your enterprise subscription.\nThis means you can start building apps without investing in new software or learning any programming languages besides C#. You can also incorporate existing Java, C, and C++ code from your own or third-party libraries.\nThen, you can compile your applications into .apk or .ipa files using either a Mac or PC, with no limitations on file size. Because Xamarin offers cross-platform support, you’ll be able to provide a consistent user experience across all devices.\nWho uses Xamarin?\nAccording to Xamarin’s LinkedIn page, the platform is used by airlines such as JetBlue and Alaska Airlines, as well as 3M, HP, AT&T, and other technology companies.\nFor example, Alaska Airlines uses Xamarin to ensure a consistent user experience on all devices, making it easy for customers to book a ticket or check in for a flight.\nThe FOX Sports app was also built with Xamarin using Visual Studio, enabling fans to customize their interface and access real-time scores and stats.\nBut who actually uses it from day to day? In short, your developers do. Your team might benefit from using Xamarin if you need to:\nBuild cross-platform apps using Visual Studio\nShare code and logic across multiple platforms\nTest and monitor the performance of your apps\nXamarin provides a way to try out the concept of your app before investing in a native build, or to release a minimum viable product onto the market on a tight timeframe.\nIt also makes it easier to launch your app on all platforms at once, rather than making iOS or Android users wait while you develop a native app for their platform.\nXamarin might be a good alternative to native mobile app development.\nFirst, let’s get clear on what exactly a native mobile app is and why you might choose to use Xamarin instead. There are three main types of mobile apps:\nNative apps\nProgressive apps\nHybrid apps\nNative apps are apps that are built specifically for use on a single operating system, so they provide the best user experience, incorporating all of the features of a smartphone, including the GPS, camera, Bluetooth, and more.\nThe downside to native apps is that they require more time and money to develop, and their larger file sizes mean they use more space and take longer to download.\nNative apps can be built using a range of programming languages, such as C++, Java, and Python, but you’ll need to code them separately for iOS and Android.\nProgressive apps, or web apps, run directly in the web browser, so they don’t require a separate download. Progressive apps use less data than native apps, but don’t have the same functionality as a downloadable app.\nFor example, the Twitter Lite web app runs using only 600KB of data, compared to the 23.5MB app, loading in around 5 seconds on a 5G network.\nProgressive apps are designed to provide an app-like interface and features, such as the ability to send push notifications and work offline.\nBecause they run on web-based code, such as HTML5, CSS, or Ruby, you don’t need to customize them for each individual device. However, the user experience may vary depending on which browser the app is opened in.\nSome web apps allow users to “install” them, but this usually just means bookmarking the web address on your homescreen.\nFinally, there’s the hybrid app, which offers some of the benefits of both web and native apps. They’re essentially web apps that have been made to work like native apps.\nThis means they can work across platforms, just like web apps, but still have access to the built-in features of native apps, like the GPS and camera.\nMost users won’t be able to tell the difference between a native app and a hybrid app, although there may be some compromises in performance and functionality.\nHybrid apps take less time to build, have faster download times, and most importantly, offer cross-platform support by using a shared code base.\nSome of the tools you can use to build a hybrid app are:\nXamarin (using C#)\nReact Native (using Javascript)\nCordova (using HTML, CSS, and Javascript)\nSome developers disagree over whether Xamarin apps should be considered hybrid or native apps. Unlike apps built using Cordova, which are really just web apps in a native wrapper, Xamarin apps really are native apps with native UI capabilities.\nUltimately, Xamarin apps are as close as you can get to a native app without investing in building one from scratch.\nMost importantly, you can use the same team to develop apps for all platforms, rather than having separate teams working on apps for iOS, Android, and Windows.\nBut there are some risks involved.\nDespite its benefits, there are a few disadvantages to using Xamarin. The first is that you may run into trouble if your apps have complicated graphics.\nWhile it’s easy to share logic across platforms, the UI code is unique to each platform, so graphics, games, and animations may not work properly with Xamarin.\nSecond, the Xamarin talent pool is much smaller than that of native app developers, accounting for only around 7% of developers. This means it could be harder to find enough experienced Xamarin developers for your team.\nAdditionally, you’ll have access to fewer open source libraries than you would for iOS and Android apps, specifically those available through Xamarin or .NET.\nYou’ll also have some lag time before platform updates are rolled out. Although Xamarin aims to offer same-day support, it may take some time before you can implement all of the features available in new Android or iOS releases.\nFinally, Xamarin can be expensive for professional and enterprise users. Yes, it’s free for individuals, so hiring an external developer may help you keep your costs low.\nBut if you plan to use Xamarin in-house, it will cost up to $1,199 to license Visual Studio Professional and as much as $5,999 for Visual Studio Enterprise on an annual basis.\nIs it ultimately worth it?\nWhether or not Xamarin is worth it depends on your intentions when developing an app and what skills you already have on your in-house team.\nIf you’ll be releasing the same app on multiple platforms, then it makes sense for your team to use a single tech stack and develop all of the apps simultaneously.\nYou can even develop apps for Mac OS, Apple TV and Apple Watch, and Tizen, which is used on certain wearables and IoT devices made by Samsung.\nKeep in mind, though, that you’ll still need some native developers on your team. While 90% of the code may be shared between apps, some of it is platform-specific.\nBecause Xamarin is owned by Microsoft, you can expect reliable ongoing support, as well as free courses available through Microsoft Learn.\nYou’ll also be able to view crash reports and other user data through the Visual Studio App Center, helping you recognize and fix bugs quickly.\nIn short, you’ll have access to an entire ecosystem that can be used to design apps for multiple platforms, with all of the features you’d expect from a native app.\nAnd based on a report by Forrester Consulting, you can expect your development costs to drop significantly over time, covering the cost of Visual Studio in under a month.\nYou need the right developer to help you along, though.\nUnless you have an experienced Xamarin developer on your team, we don’t suggest developing Xamarin apps on your own. An experienced developer like Zibtek will help you understand the ins and outs of app development on Xamarin.\nFrom creating the look and feel of your app, to submitting it to app stores, a developer will help you reduce the time it takes to go to market and release your app.\nWhen you work with Zibtek, you can expect high-quality code and frequent updates as our team works to build your app through regular development sprints.Reach out today to request a consultation and get a free quote for your project!

    "extractedText": "CRM\nBuilding a CRM\nIan J.H Reynolds\nExplore Ian J.H Reynolds' expertise in finance and economics through his insightful articles on market trends, investment strategies, and economic analysis.\nMore posts by Ian J.H Reynolds.\nIAN J.H REYNOLDS\n11 MAR 2020 • 7 MIN READ\nAccording to market research by Gartner, CRM (customer relationship management) software, is the fastest-growing sector of enterprise software. Although Salesforce has the largest market share at 19.5%, more small and mid-sized businesses are choosing to build their own custom CRM software instead of using an existing platform.\nIn this blog post, we’ll walk you through the steps of building a CRM platform designed specifically for your business.\nWhy build a CRM?\nFirst, why build a CRM of your own when you could just use a pre-built one? As we’ve looked at in an earlier blog post, there are several benefits to using a custom CRM.\nThe most important is that it will be tailored to your business or industry. There are no unnecessary tools to distract or confuse your employees and slow the system down. A streamlined CRM is easier to roll out and get your team to use efficiently.\nNext, you can use the same platform as your business grows, integrating it with other tools and building additional apps for specific departments. Everything will rely on the same API, so all of your teams will have real-time access to your company’s data.\nAnd finally, it may turn out to be the most cost-effective option. Out-of-the box CRMs have a lower up-front cost, but their subscription fees can add up over the long run.\nWith a custom CRM, you’ll be making a larger investment, but once it’s built, it’s yours, and you aren’t locked in to a per-user pricing structure as your company grows.\nThese are just a few reasons to build a CRM from the ground up. But building a custom CRM takes time and attention, so it’s important to plan ahead and do it right.\nSteps to building a CRM that works for your business:\nWhile a developer can help you through the process, many of the choices you have to make are still in your hands. From development to rollout, here are several steps that you can take to ensure that the process runs smoothly:\nDetermine your goals.\nThe first step to building a custom CRM is to do some research into what you want out of the platform. If you haven’t used a CRM before, sign up for a free trial of an existing platform and take it for a test drive. What works and what doesn’t?\nThe great thing about building a CRM is that you don’t have to reinvent the wheel. Many existing platforms will have some of the tools you need, just not in the right combination for your business. You get to pick and choose what you want to include.\nDo you want to automate your sales pipeline? Improve communication between teams? Use sales forecasting to better compete with your rivals? The features you need in your CRM will depend on your industry and your company’s sales strategies.\nDetermine what goals your CRM is expected to meet, and that will go a long way toward determining what type of CRM you need and which features to focus on.\nAdditionally, decide what a successful rollout will look like for your bottom line. Will you see an increase in revenue? Higher conversion or retention rates?\nRun a risk assessment and calculate your projected ROI. This will help you determine how much you can afford to invest in CRM development.\nBe as specific as possible so that you can look back on your goals and see whether or not you’ve met them, or if you need to make further changes to your CRM platform.\nKeep your customer’s needs front and center.\nNext, think about your CRM from your customer’s point of view. While they may never see the CRM’s inner workings or even realize it exists, they’ll still be interacting with it on a regular basis any time they communicate with your sales or support teams.\nOne of your objectives should be to streamline the customer experience by listening to their needs and providing quality customer support with a personalized touch.\nFor example, one of the biggest pain points that customers encounter is having to tell their story to multiple support reps in order to get their problem addressed.\nA CRM can help you avoid this problem by compiling your customer’s purchase and support history into a single profile. Now, every sales or support rep who speaks to a customer can easily look back on their previous conversations for context.\nAnother important component of a customer-centric CRM is channel management. This refers to the tools you use to engage with customers on multiple channels.\nIf your company receives support requests on Twitter, for example, you can respond to them directly using your CRM’s social media integrations, without the customer noticing any delays or inconsistencies in their interaction.\nFrom automated chatbots to customer satisfaction surveys, there are dozens of ways to prioritize the customer experience within your CRM. Putting yourself in their shoes can help you decide which features to incorporate into the platform.\nTalk with your employees about what they need from a CRM.\nIn addition to the customer experience, your employees’ user experience is important too. After all, they’re the ones who will be using the platform the most.\nThe biggest hurdle to CRM implementation is a lack of employee adoption. If your CRM doesn’t actually address any of their problems or make their workflow easier, then they won’t have much incentive to use it.\nInstead of springing a new CRM on them unexpectedly, talk to them about what they’d like to see in the software.\nWhile some features are included standard in most CRMs, such as a contact database, others are optional. An inside sales team might benefit from a sales dialer, while a field sales team might prefer a location-based app with geofencing.\nYou can also incorporate lead scoring and lead distribution for your sales managers, as well as roles and access levels to ensure that your employees only have access to the data that’s appropriate for their job level or department.\nUnderstanding what your managers and employees need from a CRM is key to getting full buy-in from all of the major players who will be using it.\nRoll it out in stages.\nOnce your CRM is built, it’s time to put your implementation strategy into practice. You can’t expect your team to learn a new platform overnight, so roll it out in stages.\nDepending on the size and complexity of your business, it can take anywhere from a few weeks to a year to get everyone on board.\nForm a team to take charge of the rollout and create a training schedule. If you need to, hire an experienced facilitator to deliver face-to-face training.\nYou can also create video tutorials, an online knowledge base, and self-guided lessons. Remember, any subsequent employees you hire will have to learn the software too, so the resources you invest in now will continue to be relevant in the future.\nStart by implementing the core features of your CRM, then roll out additional apps and integrations later. Don’t overwhelm your employees with too many features all at once, and make sure that your training is tailored to each department.\nHave a backup plan ready when you go live, so your operations don’t grind to a halt if you face unexpected technical difficulties. This can include having additional staff on hand to deal with any down time or customer complaints.\nGet everything synced to your CRM.\nPart of your rollout process will include data migration. This process will vary depending on whether you’re migrating from a different CRM, or directly from Excel spreadsheets.\nBefore you start, create backups of your data. Then, decide what you need to migrate to the new system. This is a great opportunity to clean up your data, for example, filling out missing information and removing duplicate records.\nYour new system may have different fields and formats than your old one, so you may have to reformat some data to ensure it’s still readable and accessible.\nAlso, consider removing data you don’t need any more, for example, records that have been inactive for many years.\nYour CRM should have automatic data entry capabilities, but take some time to review how it’s working before relying on it completely.\nTrack your progress and institute changes when needed.\nFinally, be prepared to make changes to your system as you go along. From a technical perspective, be sure to monitor the system for network speed and reliability. If changes are needed, schedule downtime in advance to avoid disruption.\nFrom a personnel perspective, ask your team leaders how the rollout is going. Are your employees adjusting to the new system, or are they still using the old one because it’s more familiar and comfortable? Review their progress with weekly meetings.\nIf they aren’t adapting to it quickly enough, assess whether additional training is needed, or whether you can shut down the old system to avoid reliance on it.\nAnd of course, view your sales figures and other internal reports. You’ll be able to see which of your departments are benefiting from the rollout, and which are not. Use this data to decide which apps or integrations to add to your CRM in the future.\nGet the right developer to help you build your CRM.\nBuilding a custom CRM takes a little more foresight than using an existing one, but you don’t have to do it alone. The developers at Zibtek will guide you through every step of the process, from deciding what tools to incorporate into your custom CRM, to helping you plan for a smooth data migration and successful rollout.\nYou’ll get personalized support as you transition to a cloud-based CRM, as well as the option of ongoing maintenance and consulting services.\nReach out to the team at Zibtek to schedule a custom CRM consultation today!

    "extractedText": "BUSINESS\nHow to craft a disaster recovery plan for your business\nIan J.H Reynolds\nExplore Ian J.H Reynolds' expertise in finance and economics through his insightful articles on market trends, investment strategies, and economic analysis.\nMore posts by Ian J.H Reynolds.\nIAN J.H REYNOLDS\n16 JAN 2020 • 5 MIN READ\nIf you are like most businesses today, your company depends on your IT infrastructure to run. Your sales team needs access to the CRM, purchasing agents to your accounting package, customers to your ecommerce site, and engineers to their computational software. In the event of a disaster, many critical operations in your business come to a halt. Do you have an up to date disaster recovery plan, or DRP, in place to make sure you return to normal operations as soon as possible?\nWe have been working with customers for years, partnering with them to develop custom software solutions and helping them understand the importance of disaster recovery as part of a comprehensive business continuity plan. This post shares lessons we have learned from our customers and during our own business continuity planning.\nWho needs a disaster recovery plan?\nEvery business is vulnerable. When we hear “disaster recovery,” we tend to think of natural disasters like hurricanes and earthquakes that impact sizable geographic areas. Planning for the more probable likelihood that part of your infrastructure will fail or that you will be the victim of a cyberattack is just as important. A fire in your building, a car hitting a power pole, or a critical file server giving up the ghost are just as devastating as an ice storm because your employees can’t get work done and your customers can’t do business with you. And if you become one of the growing numbers of hacking victims, your data could be encrypted in a ransomware attack or your network blocked through a denial of services assault.\nSome industries, like financial services and healthcare, need to pay special attention to their planning. In the financial world, almost all transactions are electronic now and nearly all the information generated is stored as digital records. A few minutes of downtime can cost a financial services company millions of dollars in lost business and may result in customers going elsewhere.\nFor healthcare, the HIPAA Security Rule requires a plan. Federal law states that when your systems are down and during your response, you do not compromise patient care or EHR security. Beyond an IT disaster recovery plan, the same rules require data backup and emergency mode operation plans.\nOther industries—from manufacturing to retail sales to entertainment—all run on digital platforms that need to get back in place as quickly as possible. Legal requirements and privacy concerns will vary, but what is certain is that it will cost you in lost business and productivity while everything is offline.\nOnce you get a feel for the seriousness of vulnerability in IT systems, you next need to understand what the specific parts of that system are. We like to sort things into four categories of IT assets:\nConnectivity – how your software connects to other software, inside and outside of your facility.\nHardware - The servers, computers, storage devices, laptops, and mobile devices along with any other machines that connect to your network.\nSoftware - The computer programs, including operating systems, that run on the hardware.\nData – Any information you store digitally in data centers or distributed across your locations and employees.\nThe last aspect you should consider before you begin crafting your DR plan is the people involved: employees, customers, and vendors. They are just as vulnerable to the repercussions of an outage as your information technology assets. And their vulnerability has a direct effect on the future success and growth of your company.\nTen essential ingredients in a well-crafted disaster recovery plan\nThe following is a list of components, or steps, for creating a robust and comprehensive DRP. Use them as a guide in your planning process, adding, modifying, and prioritizing to meet your unique requirements.\nCommit across the organization to a DRP.\nStarting with senior management, make sure that your entire company is committed to creating and following a robust disaster recovery plan. Designate someone as responsible for the plan’s development, implementation, and improvement and let them create a disaster recovery team.\nInventory your IT assets by business function.\nNext, you need to go through your IT assets: connectivity, hardware, software, and data. Identify every switch, computer, program, and database and assign each to the business functions they support.\nAssign recovery time objectives for each business function.\nWhen a disaster comes, you can not get everything back instantly. Decide which business processes are the most important so you can prioritize. A good practice is to divide the functions and their assets into three tiers: within eight hours, eight to 24 hours, and within five days.\nEstablish a role for everyone in the organization during a recovery.\nEvery team member in your organization should know what they need to do during a disaster. If appropriate, assign roles to outside vendors and customers.\nDevelop an emergency communication plan.\nAn often-overlooked part of a well crafted disaster plan is to establish a way to communicate with your employees and your customers. Capture their contact information and document how you will reach people until business operations are returned.\nDocument a data backup plan.\nBefore disaster strikes, you must have a plan in place to create copies of your data offsite that you can restore securely and efficiently. Some companies keep mirrored versions of all their data at a different geographic location. Others do not have to be back as fast and may find it more cost-effective to have regular backups at another physical location or in the cloud.\nCreate a hardware and software redundancy plan\nDetermine how you will get replacement machines and programs or how you will stage additional resources at another location for use during a disaster. This could be a mirrored data center, a secondary cloud provider, or a designated recovery site.\nUnderstand what your service level agreement (SLA) provides in a disaster.\nYou probably have data and software in the cloud with a third-party provider for external connectivity. Your service level agreement, or SLA, defines what they will do when the service they provide is not available or is damaged. Make sure you can tolerate what they agree to and, if it is not acceptable, negotiate better terms or find a vendor can meet your requirements.\nEnsure proper handling of sensitive information throughout the plan.\nBefore and after a disaster, your confidential information can become exposed. You are responsible for data protection and making sure it stays secure during transmission, storage, and use.\nBuild a test and improvement plan.\nLast, and maybe most importantly, your disaster recovery plan needs to be continuously tested to make sure it still works and fits your needs. Also, you should plan for how you will make improvements as you discover problems or new challenges arise.\nYour software plays a role in disaster recovery planning\nHere at Zibtek, we are always thinking about where software fits. When creating your plan, consider these three roles for your software:\nSoftware is an asset that must be backed up and reinstalled.\nWhen choosing software or developing custom solutions you must consider how the programs can be stored, retrieved, and reinstalled quickly and efficiently.\nWell written tools can prevent a disaster by including robust cybersecurity measures.\nThe best disaster recovery plan is to avoid disasters in the first place. Since cybersecurity attacks are a growing cause of system downtime, make sure you include security in your development or evaluation process.\nDevelop software to be fault-tolerant and redundant.\nWhen hardware or connectivity fails, well-written software can immediately adjust. Examples are switching to mirrored databases, allowing users to work offline, and automatically switching over to different network channels.\nCrafting a robust and effective disaster recovery plan is a continuous process and has significant challenges. But it is also necessary and can have a substantial impact on the success of your company not if, but when a disaster knocks out all or part of your IT infrastructure.

    "extractedText": "BUSINESS\nDigital versus traditional wealth management: What midsize firms need to know now\nIan J.H Reynolds\nExplore Ian J.H Reynolds' expertise in finance and economics through his insightful articles on market trends, investment strategies, and economic analysis.\nMore posts by Ian J.H Reynolds.\nIAN J.H REYNOLDS\n8 JAN 2020 • 6 MIN READ\nTime marches on and with that steady beat of change, wealth is transferred to younger generations as they build their own assets. And they are mobile device users, with 93% of them owning smartphones. What’s more, the older generations that have been clients for a while are not ignoring technological change—they are adopting online and mobile tools as a means of understanding and managing their financial health. Customers’ interactions with their financial advisors are moving to digital, driven by the expectations of clients as well as the efficiencies realized by firms who automate their processes digitally.\nThe digital transformation of fintech sweeping across financial institutions from online banking to corporate financial management is an opportunity for firms of all sizes to increase their efficiency. And the pressure on asset managers is growing. A 2018 Bain & Co study found that:\nCustomers are moving to passive investments.\nNew regulations will increase costs.\nDownward pressures on fees will decrease profit.\nThey predict that “a collapse of plain-vanilla, smaller or mid-sized firms with no competitive advantage… is a highly likely scenario.”\nWhat is your financial planning firm doing to create a competitive advantage? The need for digital technologies is a chance to differentiate yourself in the market with better tools that meet or exceed your clients’ digital expectations. Smaller firms have the advantage of understanding their customers better, can make decisions sooner, and can execute initiatives faster.\nWith planning, the right partners, and a focus on customer’s needs, mid-sized firms have an opportunity to nimbly deliver digital wealth management services while larger companies are still blundering forward with generic solutions. As you plan your firm’s digital finance strategy, here are a few things you should know; these are the lessons we have learned assisting other companies with their projects.\nFive suggestions to leverage what mid-sized traditional wealth management firms do best, customer experience\nWhy do your customers count on your company to manage their wealth? For most firms, it is the positive relationships clients have with your employees, the products you offer, and the level of service you provide. The customer experience. These are all differentiators that should become part of your digital transformation plan. Customer experience matters and a survey by BDO recently uncovered that digital transformation benefits customer experience by leveraging data-driven insights, enabling engagement with new customers, providing a way to compete for existing customers, and streamlining processes.\nConsider these five suggestions to make a difference with the customer-facing portions of your digital platform:\nBuild the trust and experience you offer now into your digital platform.\nYour clients have made a conscious choice to entrust their assets to your company and your employees. Use surveys and interviews to understand what attracted them and keeps them. Then include those strengths and differentiators into the design of your new platform.\nMake it easier for clients to interact with the people they trust in your organization.\nA crucial part of your current success is the trust your clients have with your financial advisors and administrative staff. Trust is the most important asset for wealth management firms. Digitization should automate the tasks that don’t require experienced advisors and free those advisors up to do what automation and artificial intelligence algorithms can’t do: build relationships and understanding with clients.\nStay nimble, updating capabilities and adding features frequently.\nThe initial release of a digital platform is just the start. Leverage the flexibility available in a mid-sized wealth management firm and continue to improve the tools you offer. Add new features to take advantage of improvements in mobile devices. Keep your eye on digital assistants like Alexa, Cortana, Siri, and Google Assistant. Stay up-to-date with the technology and changes in the wealth management industry.\nProvide a variety of value-added services through your digital platform.\nCustomers want to do more than review their balance and place buy or sell orders. Take what you know about where you traditionally added value and include it in your online solutions. Look at what your competitors are offering and include those services as well.\nGive clients actionable data to guide their decision making.\nOne of the most powerful features of a digital platform for wealth management is giving clients real-time access to financial data: where the assets currently are and what markets are doing as they change and shift. Work to convert that raw information into actionable data that will allow them to make smarter decisions faster. Real-time access to data can also enable new technologies, more informed risk management, and insight into new opportunities.\nFive suggestions to integrate and automate your traditional financial management processes\nYou have a successful business now, providing financial services to your customers. You must be doing some things right with your traditional processes. Transitioning your firm to be a digital wealth management company should be based on what you have learned in the past. Not just what to transform, but also what to abandon when you make the shift. In their whitepaper on digital transformation, EY makes it very clear that when developing an end-to-end digital strategy, companies “must decide whether they can enhance or transform their existing models, or whether they need to invent a new model.” We could not agree more.\nOver the years we have helped a variety of companies in the financial space with their digital strategy, and have developed the following five suggestions to improve on the advantages you have now, and to identify and leave behind what in your business model is holding your firm back:\nMap your processes and the flow of information.\nUnderstand how your employees do their job and how your customers access your services today. Our customer journey mapping process is a good place to start. Make sure you capture not just what people do but also what information moves through those processes.\nTake the time to identify user frustration and manual steps.\nNo matter how good your people and processes are now, there will be areas that generate frustration with employees and clients. There will also be steps where humans are manually creating, entering, or extracting information. Identify these pain points and work with your development team to eliminate them. If spreadsheets are being used, identify what they do and replace them with integrated tools or reports.\nInvest in changing the mindset of your users.\nChanging the technology behind a process does not change the process itself. Investing in modifying the expectations and habits of your clients and employees is critical to a successful digital transformation. Use marketing, informal training, and the relationship your advisors have with your clients to get everyone on board with the new, better way of managing their wealth afforded by your new digital platform.\nFocus on connecting data across your enterprise.\nThe efficiencies for your firm created by digitization of your processes often come from the integration of your company’s datasets. Leverage the big data you have in silos now. Your client management tools should be part of a comprehensive enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system that integrates data from accounting, customer support, IT, sales, marketing, and whatever other solutions you use.\nDigitize the complete customer journey.\nClients expect the ability to do everything they want to do from their preferred device. They should never have to stop mid-transaction and call someone in your support center or wait for something to be mailed to them. Their entire journey should be digitized.\nStand out in the crowd: Evolve your culture and make your digital transformation a competitive advantage\nChange is never easy and always costs time and money. Taking on a transformation from a traditional wealth management firm with a hodge-podge of online tools to a digital customer-centric organization can be both a challenge and an opportunity. Companies that embrace the opportunity and plan for the challenge will grow and prosper. Those that stay with what worked in the past will be left in the past.\nTo maximize the positive impact of digital transformation, invest in shifting your company culture towards this new way of doing business. Involve the entire organization, not just IT. IT can implement the software, but they don’t understand client needs and they can’t change how you do business. Culture change also includes educating clients on the new technology, new workflows, and advantages afforded by new tools and processes.\nDigital transformation also means creating the tools that integrate and digitize your data and move your customer interaction onto a computer or smartphone. Creating that competitive advantage with solutions that truly differentiate your company requires a team that understands how to transition from traditional to digital. You need a team that can manage a large project, gather information from across your organization, identify what makes your offering special, and turn everything into an experience that delights your customers and enables your employees. And, most importantly, support you as you add users and continuously improve your digital experience.At Zibtek, we have the experience and proven processes to transform your business into the digital age. With our focus on small and medium enterprises, we provide a full solution including design, strategy, software development, and support.

    "extractedText": "ERP\nWhat to Look For in an ERP Software Development Company\nIan J.H Reynolds\nExplore Ian J.H Reynolds' expertise in finance and economics through his insightful articles on market trends, investment strategies, and economic analysis.\nMore posts by Ian J.H Reynolds.\nIAN J.H REYNOLDS\n26 NOV 2019 • 6 MIN READ\nThe decision has been made. It is time for your company to adopt a full Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system across the organization. You have looked at off-the-shelf solutions and found them expensive, and they would require massive customization to deliver the workflows you need. Your next step is to find a software development company that can create the solution you and your team have envisioned, and that senior management is now expecting. This company will be the team in the trenches with you for a long time designing, coding, implementing, supporting, and then improving your ERP solution. This is a crucial choice.\nThat is why it is essential to understand what makes ERP unique in the world of business software and what skills are needed in a development organization to deliver the considerable benefits of an integrated system. This article will discuss the differences and then suggest what to look for in the firms you are evaluating.\nERP software is big and complex\nWhat makes choosing a software development company for ERP complicated are the unique challenges faced when developing this type of software. Reviewing what ERP software does is an excellent place to begin to understand the problem. Gartner, who coined the term ERP, define it like this:\nEnterprise resource planning (ERP) is the ability to deliver an integrated suite of business applications. ERP tools share a common process and data model, covering broad and deep operational end-to-end processes, such as those found in finance, HR, distribution, manufacturing, service, and the supply chain. – (Gartner Glossary, Information Technology)\nThe phrase that should give pause to anyone looking for an ERP development service provider is “common process and data model covering broad and deep operational end-to-end processes.” ERP systems are, by their very nature, large, complex, and created to manage a wide variety of business needs. ERP essentially combines business software tools like CRM, HRM, customer service, supply chain management, and many more in one interconnected system.\nBecause an ERP system is a collection of applications, it produces five unique challenges:\nSeparate software modules\nMultiple, often conflicting business needs\nShared data across applications\nIndividual user needs, terms, and workflows\nComplex project management for each module and coordinating modules\nTake some time to think about these challenges and how critical each one is to your project. This will help you prioritize what is essential in your software partner.\nCreating ERP solutions requires skills beyond software development\nKnowing the unique challenges of ERP software development, you can now evaluate service providers to see if they have what it takes. They must, of course, have the skills required by any development team, but equally important is how they fit in with your unique project goals.\nBusiness.com provides a straightforward guide to choosing a software development provider:\nKnow what you want.\nPartner with a company that understands you.\nUnderstand their areas of expertise.\nMake sure they are good: Visit their content, review case studies.\nCheck on references.\nKnow their capacity.\nKnow your budget and make sure the proposal lines up.\nMake sure they are a stable company.\nUnderstand their software development model.\nGet a free consultation or sample.\nTalk to customers about the quality of their after-project support.\nThe most critical item in this list for an ERP software project is to “understand their areas of expertise.” If you tie this back to the unique challenges an ERP project faces, you can develop the following five characteristics that should describe a company creating an ERP system.\nUnderstands multiple business cases\nRemember, an ERP system addresses the needs of many different departments in a company. A software development company may have a good understanding of sales or inventory, but that is not good enough. They need to have the ability to listen to their clients and understand the underlying business justification for any feature within an ERP system—across your company. If they don’t understand the business cases, they will struggle to provide software that meets your needs.\nExpertise in data integration\nEven though one of the advantages of ERP software is that they have a single database for multiple applications, that data still needs to be integrated across the system. In addition, there are always external applications that need to be connected to your ERP system, and they often have their own set of requirements. You should use a software development company that understands data and how to integrate it within the various modules in an ERP system, legacy systems, and external applications.\nHandles multiple types of users\nProper user interface design is one of the most important predictors of the adoption of a software product. With ERP software, developers need to design the user interface for a wide variety of users. Hourly maintenance workers have different expectations and needs than data scientists. Accountants need a set and predictable set of screens that avoid human error and are reliable every time. Your software development partner should not cater to one type of user. They must be able to flexibly identify the proper user interface for each kind.\nTools, people and process in place to manage large projects\nEvery software company has some type of project management—they could not survive long without one. But do they have the processes, people, and tools in place to manage a project as complex and varied as developing ERP software? Ask them about their most extensive projects. Dig deep to see how many modules it had, how many development teams were deployed, and how long the project took. Try and get a feel for how they capture specifications, turn those into work assignments, and then test the software. More importantly, ask them to explain to you how, from a project management perspective, they design the interface between different modules.\nShows the ability to communicate efficiently and accurately\nYou are looking to have a custom ERP system developed because you want a solution that enables your processes and meets your unique business needs. The best developers in the world will not be able to achieve these goals if they do not understand what your procedures and requirements are. Gaining that understanding requires outstanding communication skills. A company ready to take on a full ERP project must be able to listen to clients, understand what they are saying, and turn that knowledge into code. They must also be able to communicate their plans, progress, and challenges back to the customer continuously. If communication is slow or painful during the investigation period of your search, that is not a good sign.\nTake your time to find the right partner\nCreating an ERP software solution is a significant investment in time and money. You should take your time finding the right company to help you achieve your business goals. As discussed above, ERP systems are large, complex, and have a lot of moving parts. You want to make sure you find a partner that not only writes good software, but that can take on the unique requirements of ERP solutions.\nThe development team of Zibtek has faced the challenges of ERP software development and has put processes and people in place that understand how to manage large projects and carry out constant communication between development teams and users. Yes, we know how to write good software. We also know how to identify different user types and design the right user experience for each. The best way to get a feel for our capabilities is to reach out for a free consultation.\nCreating ERP Software may be the most significant investment your company makes in business software. It means you’re ready to move beyond point solutions and spreadsheets to tie things together. Creating a software tool that will take your company to the next level is challenging in scope and complexity. But the unique challenges of creating Enterprise Resource Planning software can be met with the right software development partner leading the way. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

    "extractedText": "BUSINESS\nMeetings Don’t Have to Be Boring\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n5 MAR 2019 • 4 MIN READ\nMany people think that the meetings are quite boring. This is understandable because some meetings are boring, leading some people to assume that meetings are a time-waste activity. . If you do not organize the things well, co-workers might end up fighting against each other. However, when done well, meetings can be beneficial in collaborating with the staff about various aspects.\nBut when you have excessive meetings at a stretch, besides wasting too much of the valuable time of the staff you are going to make people feel that they are micromanaged. It is essential for you to follow certain principles when you are planning a meeting. Here are some great ideas for your information that will work well.\nHave An Agenda:\nIt is essential to have a thorough agenda in place before people plan on meeting. The agenda should talk about the aspects that you plan on covering. It is vital for people to gain access to the agenda a few days before the meeting. When you do this, people will be a lot more prepared when they come to the meeting. There is no room for confusion, and since there is a reason why people are going to meet, they are a lot more excited.\nInvite Key People:\nIt is essential to invite all the key members to the meeting that you organize. By skipping some members, you are going to get stuck. Take time to see who might add value to the meeting and invite them. Always find the best time when all the invitees can attend. It is okay to skip a meeting but not the person that is important. If they cannot be physically present in person, check to see if they can connect to the meeting using various other means.\nMeetings Should Be Short:\nPeople tend to miss the main point when the meeting is going to take a very long time. Always plan on meetings that do not take much of your team’s time. It is the only way your team members will be a lot more productive, and they will not think that it is going to be boring.\nHold Meetings At Different Venues:\nIf you want to excite your team, plan on ditching conventional methods of holding the meetings. Think outside the box and plan on having the meeting outside of your office. People are more excited to get a quick trip outside their office. By holding it in different locations, you will ignite interest. No doubt that you will have a meaningful meeting by following this simple method.\nEncourage Punctuality:\nIt is essential to respect the time that other people are willing to give. It is good to start the meetings on time and close on time. You should encourage the invitees to be at the venue at least ten minutes before the meeting. The best part about doing this is that people will get time to socialize with their colleagues before the meeting starts. It will greatly help in deviating their minds from work for a few minutes.\nHave Some Fun:\nMeetings will be annoying when people do not have fun. Having some humor in the meeting is always good. Never stop people from making fun as they will enjoy being present. Plan on ways to make it fun by introducing some ridiculous rules and concepts. A security management company did just that. The management decided that people should not go back to the same topic every few minutes.\nHence, once they complete the discussion on a subject if any participant goes back to the same issue, they quickly raise a paddle that has “No Rehash” inscribed on it. It is a fun way of letting the other person know that they should not dwell on topics already covered.\nHave Good Debate:\nNow, this is the most important thing that you need to plan. People come from different backgrounds, cultures and work environments. Because of this, there are differences in opinions and perspectives. It is essential for people to share their thoughts politely. By encouraging a good debate, you will find the best ways to resolve significant issues. The person who is heading the meeting needs to have all the power to make the decision. But it is vital for all the invitees to understand this.\nWhen people get the freedom to express their opinions, they are very eager to come to the meetings. Always value the comments that people share even though you may not agree with them. If you embarrass people in public, they might not be willing to share their thoughts in the future. They might skip or come to the meeting and not contribute anything.\nEncourage Respect:\nIt is essential that everyone listens to the thoughts that others share in the meeting. Encourage invitees to respect each other by listening to the comments of another person. Cross talking might not fetch good results as people will not be that attentive.\nThese are some crucial steps that you can follow when organizing a meeting. Let the invitees know these principles so that they can come prepared. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

    "extractedText": "APP DEVELOPMENT\nHow To Choose Between Native Or Hybrid App Development\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n18 APR 2018 • 3 MIN READ\nWhen it comes to app development, the options are endless. You’ve got so many questions to answer; what’s your budget? Will your app be built to scale? Should you develop a native app or see what the hybrid hype is about? A good place to start is knowing what your options are for app development frameworks. We’ll give you the rundown.\nBefore committing to an app development strategy, it’s best to know your app’s intended use, as one framework may be better than the other. Some things to take into account are app performance, user experience, fragmentation, monetization, security, availability of programming expertise, cross-platform deployment costs, timeliness of new OS innovations, and updates and distribution control.\nNative Novelty\nA native app is probably what comes to mind when you think of mobile apps. Native apps are designed to be inherent to the specific platform they are developed for, for instance iOS, Android or Windows Phone.\nNative Pros\nApp Speed- because the app has been designed for each specific platform, apps can operate more quickly.\nSupports Complex Visuals- apps that survive on good graphics (like a game).\nAccess to Built-in Mobile Capabilities- access user’s camera in an instant without the use of plugins or pinging API’s.\nPush Notifications- push notifications remind the user to open the app and check their alert, making your application used more often.\nSmoothness of UX- each mobile platform is different, therefore responsiveness amongst platforms is best when created for the specific mobile platform.\nNative Cons\nSavvy Developers Required- developers need experienced with each platform SDK and programming language for every platform you wish to target.\nObjective-C is Hard- When building your app for iOS users, developers will use Objective-C or Swift and neither are easy languages to learn or master for that matter. Although the dev community is relatively happy with Xcode, the tool your developer will use to build your native app, it does still come with it’s own steep learning curve.\nThe Hybrid Hype\nHybrid apps on the other hand are more like websites. They are built using several web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These hybrid apps are hosted inside a native app that uses your mobile platform’s WebView. This allows the app to access native device components such as the camera, GPS or your contacts list. There are several frameworks from which these apps are built.\nHybrid Pros\nApp Building Speed- hybrid apps can be built much faster than native apps due to the fact that they need to be built only once versus native apps which are built for each specific mobile platform.\nCross-platform Appeal- write your code once and have it accessed on multiple device types. One set of code can target multiple platforms.\nShared Code Base- makes app development and maintenance efficient.\nHybrid Cons\nMediocre Technology Combination-combining web apps with native apps (that’s where the name hybrid comes from) can lead to an end product that lacks the slimline style of a web app or the killer features of a native app.\nPoor Performance- the hybrid mobile framework used puts an extra layer between the source code and the targeted mobile platform, this can cause lackluster performance that varies amongst devices.\nDebugging Nightmares- the aforementioned extra layer can cause serious bugs. Frameworks and operating systems don’t always play nice. Hybrid app developers may not have a thorough understanding of the targeted platform leading to extended timelines for debugging.\nSmall Screen, Big Results\nNow that you’ve seen the options, you’re on your way to deciding between native or hybrid. Often times, it’s the execution of development that matters. Depending on your budget and your needs, there are options available. Ready to start building? Tell us about your project.

That's why sales reps are encouraged to filter their prospects. Sales reps will still experience the opposition of \"no need\", though, even after correctly qualifying their leads.\nHow to handle it\nProspects sometimes don't know about their own needs, because nobody has pointed that out to them. You can readily overcome this objection if you can help them see the requirements and possibilities that they are overlooking currently.\nSatisfied with the current service provider\nIt is human nature to be drawn into a false sense of security. People get complacent and they are afraid of progress or change. This is one of the common objections that occur in sales.\nHow to handle it\nIf the customer is held back because they are scared of new changes then you should tell them the disadvantages of not being bold enough to take the first time.\nAfter the introductory call, the prospect asks you leave some information\nWhen clients shake off your connection request and ask you instead to leave some information, they are not likely to respond. It's the classic scenario of \"Don't call me, I'll call you\" that can stall sales.\nHow to handle it\nDefinitely do send more information, but do it only after diving deeper and discovering what kind of advantages and characteristics of your product / services they want the most.\nNot enough budget\nObjections to pricing are the most common ones in sales. And the first response of many salespeople is to immediately grant a reduced cost.\nHow to handle it\nWhen a prospect says \"I don't think we've got the budget to afford this\" it doesn't mean they can't really buy it on many occasions.

A CRM system revolutionizes the way companies communicate with clients, but how can you better integrate CRM in your company? Here are a few important considerations for making the most of your CRM:\nAlways maintain revised customer data\nProbably you and your team have methods in place for optimizing input, reporting, and the use of information for revenue improvement. Once fresh information is gathered, you must renew your client data. Your CRM system provides useful information for customers.\nIntegrate your CRM with other business software\nMake it even more effective by integrating CRM with other software. Customer and monetary information are combined with the accounting software integration, eliminating unnecessary internal information and offering more in-depth accounts.\nAutomate mundane tasks to free up time for more important tasks\nAutomate the maximum number of tasks. Ensure that the aim of your CRM technology is to simplify your work life. Provide the automation of the workflow of a CRM. Remove repeated information input, prevent mistakes and assist the efficiency of your team.\nAlways be updated with current trends\nBe aware of recent developments to enhance your own CRM configuration. Update the latest version of your CRM software regularly and don't overlook new developments like innovative artificial intelligence. A CRM that can be obtained through various appliances is essential.\nSet goals and know how to measure them\nSpecify targets and key performance indicators (KPIs). Only if businesses have transparency on what they are going to accomplish will a CRM approach succeed. It is essential to establish objectives and KPIs for their evaluation. You can monitor advancement, customer satisfaction and ongoing enhancement once these are established.\nHelp your team to know the CRM software, invest time in training them now so you don't regret it later\nYes, it takes time to adjust to changes. Adoption of CRM can be difficult. According to research, 40% of staff do not understand how to use a CRM tool. Your team might at the beginning be skeptical of changes, but all members of your team will need to be on board and trained for efficient use.\nBetter decisions with analytical data\nUse your production process information. A seller who already understands the picture of a customer is more likely to close a deal. Analysis of customer behavior is one of the major benefits of getting a CRM tool. Why waste time and money on a project that does not relate to the client? A company can benefit from a good and calculated approach. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

AI is opening the door for new business opportunities and creating entirely new business models. The adoption of AI by industries is ushering in this digital evolved era.\nIn 2018, AI made a huge impact on how companies run their operations and engage with customers. It had a profound effect on almost every sector such as IT, healthcare, banking, automobiles, and manufacturing.\nThe year 2019 is also going to witness the advancement of AI. Considering its potential, companies are investing in AI research and development. It will transform the way humans interact with computers.\nHere are the top Artificial Intelligence trends in 2019-\n1. Use of Specialized Chatbots in DevOps: A revolutionary upholder in enterprise\nCurrent industry trends show huge popularity for chatbots. Industries are paving the way to embrace this technology. They are adopting chatbot solutions to reduce operational cost and time-consuming tasks.\nGeneric bots like Cortana, Siri, and Alexa are capable of handling basic end-user queries. But they lack domain expertise and are unable to grasp the context. This makes them ill-suited for enterprise industries. To evolve the automation, organizations are now focusing on developing specialized chatbots. These chatbots possess self-learning capabilities to understand the contextual information.\nSpecialized chatbots used in DevOps are the top use case for AI. They understand the requirement of regular human language. It makes them a great tool for the whole support system. These chatbots help in:\nDoing all back-end jobs and fetching appropriate files\nInvoking automated test cases\nProviding status reports from data-center, etc.\nMicrosoft Azure Bot service is making headway in this technological advancement. It is helping organizations in creating, building, deploying and managing intelligent bots. It will speed up the development process and meet their business requirements.\n2. AI- Cognitive computing and IoT at the Edge: Making businesses more responsive to customers\nMammoth amounts of data are getting generated across organizations. So, the businesses are looking for flexible solutions to deploy AI and IoT services in a wide range of environments. The edge computing is receiving interest at the global level. It processes the data at the source instead of a central data-storage warehouse. To gain more control over data and to extract insight the data has to offer, organizations are adopting intelligent Edge.\nIn 2019, Microsoft announced Azure Cognitive Services Container. It lets developers seamlessly add cognitive features—such as natural language processing, face detection in images or videos, speech translator—into their applications, with no need of having thorough domain expertise in AI or Data Science skills.\nNVIDIA Jetson TX2 is a powerful platform, empowering AI computing at the edge. It is unlocking the door of high-powered intelligent robots, drones, and smart cameras.\nRapidly advancing AI technologies are integrating with IoT networks. It enables smart machines to simulate intelligent behavior and make accurate decisions, with little or no human intervention.\n3. Specialized AI chips: Empowering businesses in the era of smart machines\nAI chips have lessened the cost of accelerating AI applications in cloud/edge computing and enterprise data centers. They are also meant to increase the performance of both training and inference phases in Machine Learning.\nThe market for AI accelerators (GPUs, FPGA, ASICs) is expected to grow from $15 billion in 2019 to $25.5 billion in 2022. Companies like NVIDIA, IBM, and Intel are planning to develop next-gen AI chips. These will optimize machine learning skills and reduce data analytics workloads in data centers. The performance of AI-enabled edge applications will also get enhanced.\nTraditional von Neumann chip architecture consumes precious energy and time due to the data shuttle between memory and processor. To overcome this challenge, companies like IBM have designed Neuromorphic AI enabled chips. It models more closely to the biological brain, hence, extracting the accurate conclusions from little information.\nIn 2019, Intel is all set for the shipment of two Nervana Neural Network Processors–\nIntel NNP-L 1000 for Training\nIntel NNP-i 1000 for Inference.\nThese NNPs put the trained model to work for deeper insights and drawing conclusions. At the same time, they support general as well as Neural network acceleration.\nAmazon has announced AWS Inferentia– a machine learning inference chip that will use trained machine models and make predictions accordingly. It will support the deep learning frameworks such as:\nTensorFlow\nApache MXNet\nPyTorch\nAnd, models that use the ONNX format.\n4. Automated machine learning: Training your own custom ML model\nAutomated machine learning (AutoML) is renovating Machine Learning (ML) based solutions. It is assisting businesses by making the machine learning available as a service that they can use to easily train predictive ML models.\nIt lets business analysts and software developers stay focused on their projects while addressing the complex issues at the same time, without distracting them with the process of training ML models.\nAutoML will find the middle ground between cognitive APIs and custom machine learning platforms. It offers software developers with the customization options, with which they can train, assess, improve and deploy models based on their company’s own data.\nYet, some AutoML approaches take too long to train the models and operate for only a handful of parameters. To address these issues, Microsoft’s research center is creating AutoML techniques. These techniques are expecting to outperform existing approaches.\n5. Enabling interoperability among neural network: Get great ideas into production faster\nIn 2019, Interoperability has become a cornerstone for AI platforms. It will standardize the Neural Network models.\nOver the past few years, the lack of interoperability has complicated the development of neural network models. Data scientists and developers are required to select the right machine learning tools (Caffe2, PyTorch, TensorFlow). Once the model is trained and evaluated in a specific framework, its deployment to another platform complicates the issue.\nTo address this challenge, tech giants, including AWS, Facebook, and Microsoft, have united and released Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX). ONNX will become a crucial technology for the industry. Here are some key points about ONNX:\nIt enables interoperability between machine learning frameworks, thus making cross-platform deployment easy.\nIt will make the hardware optimization easier.\nThe ONNX project has spanned more than 27 companies.\nONNX Runtime is an open source, high-performance inference engine for machine learning models in the ONNX format.

    "extractedText": "CUSTOM SOFTWARE\nModernizing your legacy system for efficient digital transformation\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n26 JUL 2019 • 7 MIN READ\nThere is no denying the fact that modern systems are more powerful, efficient and capable than legacy systems (old methodology or technology). For instance, to provide the users with a better experience, Microsoft has replaced Windows XP with the latest Windows operating system (Windows 8 or Windows 10). With time, legacy systems may not perform the way they used to. Also, there are high chances of accumulating bugs, errors or other technical issues in legacy systems. This, in turn, leads to customer dissatisfaction and can cause a huge loss in your business as well. If you want to transform your legacy systems in order to modernize your business, then this article is going to be very beneficial for you.\nIn this article, you will learn:\nFacts about legacy systems and what exactly is meant by a legacy system.\nWhy you need to modernize your legacy system\nBenefits of modernizing a legacy system\nWays to modernize your legacy system\nMajor facts about legacy systems\nAs defined by Gartner, a legacy application is “an information system that may be based on outdated technologies, but is critical to day-to-day operations.”\nFlexera, in their report of product End-of-life (EOL) or End-of-support (EOS), states that the majority of products or technologies have a 5-year lifecycle.\n(image credit: flexra.com)\nWhy do you need to modernize your legacy system?\nIntegration or compatibility issues with new apps, systems or tools\nIn order to run your business more efficiently, your old software should integrate seamlessly with other apps and tools. For example, to enhance your e-commerce website, you might need to integrate CRM with a real-time chat application on your website. For this, you need a system that is proficient enough to manage these integrations effectively.\nSecurity issues\nUsing outdated systems can jeopardize your customers and your business because legacy systems-\nAre more vulnerable to data breaches and malware.\nAre less resistant to malicious software and cyber-attacks.\nLack updates, hence they cannot adhere to the latest software standards.\nBecome non-compliant with the latest network and security standards.\nTo address these security issues, enterprises should invest in modernizing their legacy systems.\nVendor terminates the support of your legacy software\nIf you are operating a third-party software, then you always have to be dependent on your vendor for any support and updates. Unfortunately, if your vendor has discontinued support for your legacy system, then you have to change your vendor or modernize your legacy system. So, you can prevent your business from losing sensitive data, valuable time and precious money.\nLacks mobile-first approach\nIf your business app or business process cannot be accessed from mobile devices or page load time increases when someone accesses from their mobile device, then you are falling behind in today’s marketplace. With more consumers researching only on their phones, you need to have an accessible website and online presence for mobile browsers.\nYour business should follow a mobile-first web approach and update your old legacy systems accordingly.\nNo longer solving your business issues\nFor your growing business, your software should be adaptable to new business models, processes or operations. If your system lacks scalability, then you should modernize your outdated system to transform your business to a new level.\nBenefits of modernizing legacy systems\nHave a look at the following infographic that shows why modernizing your legacy software is essential for your business.\n(image credit: altexsoft.com)\nWays to modernize your legacy system\nUsing Application Programming Interface (API)\nAPI is a code that enables two software systems to communicate with each other. It connects the current system to the new system, extending the functionality and value of the current system. For example, Uber uses Google Map API to track and share locations.\nWhy to consider APIs for your legacy system?\nAPIs provide your legacy system with a new interface, making it easily accessible to other modern software components.\nUsing APIs enables you to reuse your legacy software components. You can connect your legacy system with new layers of modern systems without making major changes in the code of legacy software. This is why, using APIs is the most economical and fastest solution.\nHowever, implementing an API is not going to eradicate the maintenance and upgrade issues with your legacy software. APIs do not deal with internal problems with the software system, so other solutions may be required.\nMigration\nIn order to modernize your legacy systems, you can also migrate them to modern open systems, such as:\nX-86 environment (advanced microdevice based on Intel 8086 and 8088 variant)\nMigrating to the x-86 environment is a cost-effective approach. At the same time, it will reduce the requirement for power and memory space.\nCloud\nAs compared to hardware migration (like x-86 environment), cloud migration offers more flexibility and scalability. It doesn’t require you to set any additional hardware. Also, it will provide you greater scalability, data security, and continuous updates.\nCloud migration can be executed using three techniques:\nRehosting\nReplatforming\nRefactoring\nLet’s understand the difference between these cloud migration techniques:\nWhat does it mean?\nIn this technique, you can lift and shift your legacy system to the cloud as it is, without making any modifications in the code.\nIn this technique, minimal changes are made to a portion of a software component or entire software before moving to the cloud. These changes include adding the auto-scaling feature, using a managed database offering, etc.\nIn this technique, developers re-code some modules of the legacy software, without changing the external functionality of the software. It delivers high performance and maximizes operational efficiency in the cloud.\nWhen to use?\nIf the organization is more concerned about time and cost of migration\nIf your legacy software comes in the category of pre-packaged or off-the-shelf that is impossible to modify.\nIf the organization is already investing too much money in maintaining physical infrastructure.\nIf your organization wants to derive more benefits from cloud computing instead of just moving the application to the cloud.\nIf the source environment of your legacy system is not supporting the cloud then slight modification is needed.\nIf you want to automate certain tasks.\nIf it is not possible to add new features within the existing code of your application and there is a strong business requirement for adding features and functionalities.\nHow to plan which cloud migration technique you should choose for your legacy software?\nLook at the image of a cloud migration path:\n(image credit: Flux)\nFactors to consider:\nFirst, ask yourself: how is your legacy software crucial for your business?\nIf the application is supporting your critical business process and it can be sustained as it is, then you should go for rehosting technique at the lowest possible Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) . If your legacy software cannot run in the cloud, then you have to purchase a SaaS subscription.\nIf the application is necessary for your business and contributes to generate revenue but it cannot be sustained as it is, then you should ask yourself: is it good to invest in the application? If yes, then you should go for re-platforming or refactoring technique according to your business needs.\nBreak down the monolith architecture and use microservices architecture\nBefore understanding why you should use microservices architecture for your legacy software, it’s important to know the difference between monolithic architecture and microservices architecture.\nDifference between monolithic architecture and microservices architecture\nMonolith architecture\nMicroservices architecture\nIt is a software development pattern in which all the code elements (including backend services and the user interface) are interdependent and concatenated together.\nIt is a software development pattern in which services (features and modules of the product) are independent of one another and running separately from each other.\nMost legacy software is built using this architecture, and it’s hard to adapt to new technologies. Also, its codebase is so large that developers find it difficult to make changes quickly.\nIn this, branches of business logic are physically separated, making it easier for the application to handle high load and implement the complex systems.\n(image credit: altexsoft.com)\nHow does microservices architecture help in modernizing legacy software?\nYou can build new applications based on microservices architecture and make it run simultaneously with a monolith application. In this way, you are giving a chance to your legacy application to act more like a microservice application. Hence, it will become easier for you to manage your legacy application. One of the popular ways to implement microservices is:\nBreaking down the monolith:\nGenerally, monolith architecture comprised of 3 models: front-end (user interface), back-end (business logic), and databases. Breaking down these models into smaller applications, building blocks and configurations will make it easier for the developers to scale the application. It is one of the most popular methods to implement a microservices architecture. This method can also be used in a containerization technique.\nWhy microservices architecture for legacy modernization?\nIndependent elements of microservices architecture enable better communication among the development team. For developers, it will be easy to fix bugs and issues faster.\nIn microservices, each service is being deployed independently. This means developers don’t need to synchronize each and every process, making the deployment task easy and saving a lot of time and resources.\nIf there is any performance issue in the monolithic application, then you need to scale all the software components together. Whereas in microservices, you can scale only those components that are having performance issues.\nRedesigning\nRedesigning means rebuilding or rewriting the software components from scratch, maintaining the specifications and scope of the software at the same time. In this way, your legacy software can have access to new functionalities, features and modern technology.\nIn conclusion:\nModernizing legacy software is risky, complex and may require a large workforce. But it is well worth the risk and initial investments if you are choosing the right strategy according to your business requirements. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

    "extractedText": "BUSINESS\nWhat is a Minimum Desirable Product?\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n12 NOV 2018 • 4 MIN READ\nUsing a data-informed process of developing a product means you won’t be building willy-nilly, but instead you methodically test the features of the product as you develop it. The million dollar question, however, is what exactly are you testing in your product? You must be building it to test the viability of the product. One of the lean startup gurus introduced the term Minimum Viable Product.\nNow, what exactly is the minimum viable product? In a nutshell, an MVP is a product without all the bells and whistles. It has limited features and focuses on the core functionality. Once you’ve made an MVP, you can introduce a stripped down product to see if it will resonate well with the target market. Some of the early users might pay money for the product while others might give you their valuable feedback. But you should ensure that the product that you develop actually helps in solving a significant problem that a customer is facing.\nAt this stage, it’s a good idea to set up a website and online marketing in order to analyze how interested your target market is in the product you’re developing. By having a website where people can sign up for the MVP pre-launch, you’ll have a lot of data about the potential success of your product. Most importantly, look at the conversion rate of your web traffic to product sign-ups. Running a limited-time offer on the landing page is a great way to check how interested people are in registering on your site for the product.\nViable or Desirable\nWhile MVPs are very popular, they are not the only way of testing the waters of a target market and launching a product. Most companies pursue product development with a primary focus that is entirely different from others. For example, some businesses have a strong strategic emphasis on making a return for stakeholders. They’re going to be most interested in evaluating if a product is viable from a cost and potential sales perspective. They’ll focus on questions like how large the target market is, how much people are willing to pay, and how long it will take to scale up the business.\nOn the other hand, some businesses, especially in the world of tech startups, focus on a specific technology that they want to bring to market. These engineering-focused teams are less concerned with the nuts and bolts of business analytics and are more concerned with ensuring the feasibility of the product they are making.\nYou’ll also find some startups that are most concerned with desirability of a product in development. They’ll focus on how users respond to a product’s look and feel, what features they are seeking in addition to core functionality, and how to ensure longevity in customer usage.\nThe Need For An MVP\nLooking at all these different methods for evaluating a product in development, it’s clear that the MVP is best suited for the business analytics-focused business. An MVP is not going to provide adequate data on feasibility or desirability if it sticks to the industry standards.\nThe information you can gather with an MVP is certainly useful. If you create a successful MVP, based on user sign-ups, pricing, and feedback, you will know you have a commercial product with a good chance of success.\nHowever, if you’re interested in creating a product that is focused first and foremost on the individual user experience, you may want to consider a minimum desirable product (MDP) instead. With this model, you don’t want to offer a totally stripped-down user experience, but instead a really attractive design that will satisfy users beyond the core functionality of your product.\nMVP Versus MDP\nIt is crucial for you to understand the differentiation between an MDP and MVP. Developing knowledge about the key differences between the two will give you a competitive advantage in approaching product development.\nIf you developed a popular app that brings in a lot of revenue but has super high user turnover, you can bet you’ve made an MVP and not the MDP.\nIf you’ve launched a dating site that has tons of new users willing to commit to a monthly subscription fee but very few users willing to commit to an actual date with other users you developed an MVP and not an MDP.\nA game site that gives cash rewards to users would obviously be insanely desirable but good luck making that viable.\nYou may have created a fun kitchen gadget that all your friends and family swear by but you can’t convince any business partners to go in on it. This would probably be an example of an MDP and not an MVP.\nDo you think desirability is the more important metric?\nMost consumer internet services do not care if they have a viable business, at least in the beginning. Tech startups are often looking to scale something into a massive internet phenomenon over the next five years instead of trying to make a quick buck today. That’s the reason that the focus is usually on finding a target market instead of focusing first on making the business profitable. If you have a great product and a large enough target market, you’ll become profitable over time.\nFor these reasons measuring product desirability can be a more important metric that viability. As shown above, you can have products that are desirable but not viable, but for the most part, if you have legitimate appeal from a desirability perspective in a large enough market, you’re going to have a viable product.\nMinimum Feasible Product\nIt’s important to note that MVP and MDP are not the only approaches to a product launch. A minimum feasible product is a way to assess a product that is focused on a technological function instead of a mass market appeal. A great example of this would be a new pharmaceutical drug that cures cancer.\nIf your product actually cures cancer, it will definitely be viable and desirable, so you would not be concerned with an MVP or an MDP. Instead, your focus in the initial stages would be the minimum amount of development involved in making a feasible drug for curing cancer.\nThere are many ways of assessing the potential success of a new product. It’s important to find the approach that fits your product so you can gather the most relevant information. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

While time is always in short supply in a startup environment and waiting 10 minutes to restart your computer doesn’t seem like a great use of time, it is. Whether you’re installing an automated systems update from Windows or Apple, or connecting with your developer on improvements he’s made to your code, software maintenance should be a top priority for companies big and small. There are several negative side effects to having outdated programs. We’ll convince you that it’s important by giving you five reasons to update your software.\nLet’s get one thing straight; there is a difference between a software update and a software upgrade. A software update is something we are all used to seeing (and hopefully installing) on our smartphones, computers, and tablets. It’s that irritating notification that pops up right in the middle of a Netflix bender. Unfortunately, updating your device’s software will interrupt your fourth consecutive episode of Fuller House, but it will keep your device running in good order. If you’re using custom built software, that will need to be updated as well. It won’t be quite as easy as selecting the notification on your iPad, but it too is worth your time.\nA software upgrade, on the other hand, will allow you to improve a program by accessing its next major version. An example of this would be installing Windows 10 on your PC instead of the old news, Windows 8.1. Both updates and upgrades are important. An update is a free improvement to an existing software written by developers to better the product. An upgrade generally involves some user cost to move to the newest version.\nGo ahead and install that update so you can get back to whatever cheeky drama the Tanner family is navigating this episode!\nThe Importance of Maintaining Software Updates\nThe main benefits of maintaining software updates are that security remains on point, usability is firing on all cylinders, and your software is compatible with other all the software you use.\nImprove Functionality\nSoftware speed is important for all types of industries but affects some more than others. Either way, isn’t it irritating when you’re waiting for something to load? Feature enhancements are another key to ideal functionality. A recent update to WordPress, for example, has bolstered contextual searches, improved user theme management, and even allows the ability to manage multiple sites under one account. The ability to manage multiple sites under one roof is a huge time saver for developers and designers who oversee several sites at a time.\nSquash Software Bugs\nSoftware updates fix the bugs that inevitably find their way into even the most used software in the world. When new features and functionality are created, new bugs arise. Updates mitigate those new bugs that were introduced. Maintaining healthy code is an absolute must for any business. Any reputable web host will be constantly updating their hosting infrastructure. A CMS or website that is not working on the newest version of software may not operate efficiently with new patches created by the web host. If this scares you don’t worry, there is an easy fix–update your software as soon as possible.\nMinimize Costs\nWhen your software isn’t running at optimal speed or performance, it takes longer for your employees to complete tasks. While that time may seem nominal, it adds up. Save money (on outdated software and Tylenol for employee software related headaches) by updating to the newest version of any software your workforce is using.\nIncrease Employee Productivity\nYou may be thinking, how do I know when my software needs to be updated? Is it slower, buggier and more frustrating each day? Then it’s time! Performing software updates will streamline the processes your employees are using to complete their work, saving them and you serious dough. Happy staff who don’t have to deal with tech issues makes your life so much easier.\nClose Security Gaps\nUnfortunately, hackers and viruses exist. When a new update is available for a commonly used software, like WordPress or Drupal, the update notes will disclose the previously known exploits that have since been patched. Because this is public information, an outdated site is at risk of being infected by viruses targeting those exploits. Don’t become vulnerable to viruses associated with security holes.\nCustom built software can be less vulnerable to viruses than a traditional WordPress theme. Custom software also needs maintenance too to ensure that performance is top notch and security is ironclad. For custom builds, using the latest web app development framework is a great idea. Your development team should advise you on which frameworks work best for your particular web applications. Web apps built without any framework are more difficult to update and maintain. If your application is built using PHP, using a common framework, like Laravel or Yii, allows the coding framework to be updated. This enables the latest security patches to be applied, keeping your site safe.\nWhy Security Holes are a Big Deal\nSoftware vulnerability generally exists in the form of a security hole or weakness in an operating system. These exploits can affect your device with no user knowledge. Exploits can infect your system by users doing any of the following daily activities:\nViewing an infected website\nOpening a compromised email message\nPlaying contaminated media on your device\nOnce the malware is on your computer, the hacker can take remote access of your computer, steal data stored on your computer, and even manipulate software to perform tasks not native to the program. Internet safety is no joke.\nSoftware Updates: Important for Everyone\nSoftware updates are used to optimize the performance, security, and stability of any applications running on your computer. These updates are particularly important for operating systems. Windows and Apple create non-optional updates to protect and extend the life of your devices. A good rule of thumb is to install updates that are required and even those just recommended. These updates add new features, remove outdated ones, update drivers, fix bugs, and close security gaps for your protection. If your software is custom built and is developing inefficiencies, it’s time to call your developer. Your site’s engineer will update your code to patch those same security gaps that exist in sites build on a CMS.\nChristina DesMarais from Techlicious interviewed a senior anti-virus researcher at Kaspersky Labs about which platforms are the most targeted. This researcher found that unpatched software most targeted by web exploits are: Java 56%, Adobe Acrobat Reader 25%, Windows and Internet Explorer 4%, Adobe Flash 3%, Android Root 2%, and All Others 11%.\nDon’t let software maintenance be pushed aside. While in the middle of a task, it can seem like an inconvenience to run a systems update, but its benefits in the long run far outweigh what could have been accomplished in the few minutes it takes to install.\nEngineers for custom build work hard to update your applications, making them run efficiently and protecting them from security holes. While it’s no easy task and takes some time, these five reasons alone should be enough to convince you of the importance of maintaining software updates. Keep your software running in good order, free of security vulnerabilities, and keep your employees happy by maintaining software updates for your applications and operating systems.\nIs your product developer ready?

    "extractedText": "SOFTWARE\nWhy Direct-To-India Software Development Outsourcing Is Less Efficient\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n17 MAR 2018 • 3 MIN READ\nStaying stagnant in the world of software development is a recipe for failure. In today's fast-paced tech landscape, leveraging the latest technology is crucial, whether you're launching a new product or upgrading your backend systems. You need cutting-edge tools and frameworks that are. However, finding a developer who understands these technologies and implements them effectively can be a challenge.\nIndia is home to a vast pool of highly skilled and talented developers. The issue isn't a lack of expertise. The real challenge lies in ensuring seamless communication and alignment with offshore developers on what \"cutting edge\" truly means and how to use it to create a groundbreaking platform for your business. Navigating this can be tricky, but with the right approach, it can lead to exceptional outcomes.\nExamples of modern tech adoption are everywhere. Companies like Netflix use Node.js to handle their massive data streaming needs efficiently. Airbnb leverages React to create dynamic user interfaces, while Instagram utilizes React Native for a consistent mobile experience. These companies aren't just adopting new technologies; they're pushing the boundaries and setting new standards.\nFor businesses looking to stay ahead, it’s about more than just finding developers who are familiar with the latest tech. It’s about finding partners who can innovate and drive your project forward, ensuring that your platform not only meets current standards but also sets new ones.\nCultural Barriers to Outsourced Software Development\nOutsourcing software development to India and other similar tech-forward yet still-developing nations can have certain cost efficiencies. However, unless there’s a deep mutual understanding between the outsourcer and the outsourced, those cost savings are quickly offset by inadequate skills vetting and project preparation, scheduling problems, and other communication barriers arising from cultural differences.\nSomething as simple as different holidays in the US and India can cause unexpected project delays that quickly lead to budget and timeframe overruns. Suddenly finding your developer unavailable—or your developer needing to wait an extended period to receive an answer to a question or review of a deliverable—can also cause bad feelings and further strain the working relationship. Different attitudes towards response time and clarity in terms of deadlines and other expectations can also create significant practical problems and lead to counterproductive team dynamics.\n(We actually have a running joke with our development team about the word “sometime.” It might mean today, it might mean next week, it might mean “after everything else is done.” After a good chuckle, we make sure “sometimes” becomes clear in the priorities and project timeline.)\nOur Western business perspective isn’t universal, and if you expect software developers in India or elsewhere around the globe to adapt your way of thinking automatically, you’ll be more than a little disappointed in the results.\nSoftware Development Language Barriers Aren’t Limited to Programming Languages\nJust like our Western business perspective, our language—especially the specific way(s) we speak it in the US—isn’t spoken consistently all around the globe. Amazing, we know, but true nonetheless. While English skills in India are very high, especially in the software development community, accents and different understandings of vocabulary and syntax can make phone conversations difficult and even emails uncertain.\nChoosing the right communication channels is an important part of an effective outsourced software development project. Knowing how to reach out for clarification, ensuring that you are understood and that you understand what you’re being told, is also essential.\nThere’s more than one English at work in the communications, and you need some interpretive skill on both sides to make it work.\nHow Zibtek Solves the Software Outsourcing Problem\nInstead of direct-to-India outsourcing, Zibtek’s team includes US-based project managers to facilitate communication and ensure deliverables at every step of the development process.\nWe work with a dedicated staff that is full-time employees of Zibtek in India, building long-term relationships that facilitate communication and enable us to assign the perfect developers to your project without the need for constant re-vetting. We are responsible for the developer's raises and performance plans, enabling us to create the perfect training and quality standards available.\nAnd, of course, we provide continual training to stay abreast of all the latest tech. For lean, agile, rapid development with the hottest coding around, it’s hard to beat outsourcing through Zibtek.\nAt Zibtek, we offer custom software solutions for businesses of all sizes.

    "extractedText": "5 Best Mobile Crash Reporting Software: Ranked\nVedant Vyas\nRead more posts by this author.\nVEDANT VYAS\n28 MAR 2023 • 5 MIN READ\nIn a perfect world, there would be no need for any mobile crash reporting software. Alas, we live in a gloriously messy and imperfect world where mobile apps crash incessantly, often in unexpected or unanticipated ways.\nThe best mobile app crash reporting tools use custom workflows, real-time alerting, reporting, and other strategic methods to keep you on top of debilitating errors and crashes. The best defense matters—a lot—because staying ahead of app errors, crashes, and other performance issues is critical to delivering exceptional user experiences.\nWhy Mobile Apps Crash\nApps crash for all sorts of reasons, but one of the most common is scalability.\nLet’s say you’ve earned quite the reputation for your double chocolate chip cookies, and making them for friends and family brings you—and them—great joy. One day you enter these tasty delights in your local cookie-baking contest, win the blue ribbon, and are featured on the local news.\nSuddenly, everyone in town wants a bite of the action, and what was once a manageable task is turning into a baker’s nightmare. A dozen cookies here or there is one thing, but simultaneously turning out hundreds or thousands of cookies is something else. Before you know it, you can’t keep up with the demand and the entire whole endeavor crumbles.\nIdeally, things like an app’s scalability are addressed in the planning and design process, but that isn’t always as easy as it sounds. It’s challenging to predict how many people might use an app at any given time. In an effort to launch quickly and cost-effectively, you might underestimate the number of users required.\nOther reasons mobile apps crash include:\nInadequate testing on real mobile devices.\nMemory efficiency issues.\nLack of cross-platform testing.\nLoss of traditional software life cycles(not developing it correctly)\nError-monitoring software can give you detailed insights and solutions that help prevent many app crashes from happening.\nWhy Developers and Product Managers Need Mobile Crash Reporting Software\nEveryone wants their app to:\nEarn high ratings and great reviews on the App Store or Play Store.\nBoost user retention rates.\nIncrease user engagement.\nThe average crash rate for mobile apps is two percent per user. That sounds great until you learn that the ideal app crash rate is less than one percent. Unfortunately, that two percent figure can have an adverse impact on user experience. In fact, multiple studies show that people hate when apps crash so much so that up to 80% of them will uninstall an app that crashes three times or even less.\nWhether your app is designed for consumer or in-house use, disappointing users is a quick road to abandonment. With that in mind, let’s look at some of the best mobile app crash reporting tools available.\nMobile App Crash Reporting\nAndroid vs. iOS Crash Reporting Software\nOne primary reason for mobile app crashes is the proliferation of iOS and Android operating systems. With each new update, app developers are forced to test apps on more of these platforms. The primary difference between Android and iOS crash reporting software is the type of crashes they track:\nTypical iOS crash causes include missing frameworks, memory access issues, and Swift runtime errors.\nCommon reasons Android apps crash at; null values or empty strings, complex multithreaded interactions, and invalid API arguments.\nNo matter which operating system you’re dealing with, many of these causes can be subtle and even difficult to uncover.\n5 Best Mobile Crash Reporting Software\n#1: Firebase Crashlytics\nAcquired by Google in 2017, Crashlytics is a mobile analytics tool that helps developers identify the exact line of code that an app crashes on. It provides granular insight into mobile app performance and user experience and works in real-time, so engineers can reduce the amount of time it takes to find and resolve issues.\nIdeal for Android and iOS apps, the tool makes for seamless bug tracking and project management. It also easily integrates with macOS, watchOS, and tvOS apps. Curated crash reports highlight critical issues and provide contextual information developers can use to increase stability.\n#2: UXCam\nThe UXCam platform is an all-in-one mobile app analytics tool that helps businesses deliver the perfect app experience for their users. The cloud-based solution’s lightweight crash analytics feature can be implemented in minutes and allows engineers to easily stay on top of crashes and bugs. Developers can match crashes to sessions and replay them to get a crash’s full picture, and custom alerts let them track crashes in real time.\nUXCam is used by global companies like Nissan and NBC for iOS, Android, HTML5, and Mobile Web platforms.\n#3: BugSnag\nOffering rich, end-to-end error reporting and analytics that reproduce and fix errors with speed and precision, BugSnag supports open-source libraries for more than 50 platforms. The platform of choice for companies like Lyft, Yelp, and Chime, it’s equally effective for Android and iOS apps.\nDevelopers and engineers can use the software to innovate faster, prioritize bugs in order of their impact on app stability, and increase productivity by spending less time on reproducing and fixing errors. They also appreciate the way BugSnag creates an ownership mentality by allowing them to see the effects of their coding proactively.\nMobile App Crash Reporting\n#4: Raygun\nA cloud-based bug tracking application, Raygun provides instant visibility into the quality and performance of mobile apps. Equally suitable for large organizations and SMBs across various industries, it offers crash reporting, user tracking and monitoring, deployment tracking, and integrations with other software.\nDevelopers can use Raygun to identify where users encounter errors, performance issues, or crashes. And its workflow management feature helps organize issue resolution. The preferred platform of Coca-Cola, Microsoft, and Target, it offers first-class support for all major languages and frameworks.\n#5: Rollbar\nAndroid,iOS, and React Native development teams that want to discover, predict, and resolve app errors in real-time can use Rollbar’s error monitoring platform to alert them of problems within their code. Easy to set up, the tool supports all major languages, including Ruby, PHP, and node.js. It also tells developers where the code was broken and why it broke in the first place.\nAlong with Crashlytics and Rollbar, other options for hybrid frameworks like ReactNative and Flutter include Bugfender and Instabug.\nCost of Mobile Crash Reporting Software\nChoosing the right app crash reporting tool is challenging due to rising costs relative to how much data and insight a product provides. Most products offer no-cost tier pricing plans, but as with everything else, you get what you pay for.\nNo matter how you slice it, though, compared to the costs associated with additional development and user abandonment, the expense of mobile crash reporting software is indeed a bargain. Ultimately, great mobile crash reporting software strengthens your app development and can make your apps rise to the top via positive reviews and happy users.Ready to learn more?

    "extractedText": "CUSTOM SOFTWARE\nMobile App Marketing Guide\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n27 NOV 2018 • 5 MIN READ\nThe aim of marketing an app is to get their app to as many users as possible. You can find countless apps available for download on the numerous platforms available, more than any one person could ever look at. Your ap needs to stand out amidst a great many apps that are available. As the market grows, it is no small feat to successfully gain the attention of your target audience when launching a new app.\nExperienced marketing professionals don’t rely on a single channel or a short-term timeline. Successfully marketing requires both pre- and post-launch efforts through several channels. You don’t want to rule out paid marketing or organic growth, so several channels should be considered in the strategy. Here is the complete guide that you need for app marketing. Now, this is something that every app owner needs to follow.\nBefore You Launch\nMany people realize that it is necessary to have a solid marketing strategy in place before their app goes live. If you desire to make a successful product, it is essential for you to know who your customers are and where exactly you can find them. Now, this is one of the most critical pieces of the app marketing puzzle that you need to know. These are some of the steps that you may need to follow before you launch the product.\nSelect Keywords\nIt is necessary for you to understand the keywords that matter the most for your product. While a keyword can mean so many things, in generic, it is the term that the customer uses to recognize what your app is going to do. For example, the most important keyword for a sudoku game is “sudoku.” In the same manner, as a calculator, the main keyword would be a “calculator.” These are some of the easy examples, but in some cases, you might have to use peculiar keywords and hence they might not be something that is obvious.\nThere are some tools available like MobileDevHQ App store optimization tool as well as its competitor AppCod.es which you might consider using. These tools give you more information about the keywords that people use frequently and provide insights into how to distinguish your product from your competitor’s apps. It will give you a clear image of how often people are using these keywords to search for something on the app store. It is necessary for you to select strong keywords if you want your app to be successful. It should be part of a marketing strategy.\nSelect An Excellent Name\nThough this is something that is probably obvious, in some cases, it is not. Do not forget that the name that you give to your app will often make or break it. Ensure that the name of the app is something that is memorable and unique. Including a keyword that potential users are using to search is also a great idea to get the needed attention.\nKnow Your Competitors\nOnce you decide the keywords, the next thing that you need to do is to research your competitors. Take time to find those apps that are ranking high in the app store search results using the keywords. Research about their feature set and also discover what other keywords these guys are targeting. Filter the long list of the competitors by checking the reviews left by the users.\nPick the Right Category\nUndoubtedly, deciding the category of the app is not a simple task. It is a whole different science in itself. Pick a category that will give your app a better chance to rank well. It goes without saying that not all categories are as popular as others. For example, a social category app will drive more downloads than a lifestyle category. For your app to rank high in a social category it is going to be very tough.\nThis is because if you launch a social app, you’ll be competing with Facebook, Instagram, Linkedin, Twitter, Tumblr and so forth. Beating these apps is practically impossible as people across the globe love them. Perform a risk calculation yourself and also take time to check the pros and cons of each of the categories. After doing extensive research, pick a category that is relevant for your app to succeed.\nIcon Should be Awesome\nAn icon is one of the most important aspects of your app. It conveys a message to the users about what they can expect from the app.\nCreate an icon that is appealing to the users so that they can click on it when they find it in the search results. The icon should stand out on a grid on the user’s device. Unless you carefully craft an eye-catching icon, most users are unlikely to use it frequently..\nScreenshots\nIf you want to convert a visitor to a user, the app should look convincing. Screenshots are quite essential as they can help demonstrate to the visitor the functionality and aesthetic of the app. Take the best screenshots and include them on the download page so that more people can understand how your app is going to look before they download it.\nMost people think that their journey ends the moment they launch their app. But it is definitely not so; launching the app is just the first step. There are two types of marketing once you launch the app, paid marketing and organic marketing. The best option is to choose organic promotions for which you don’t have to spend any money to get more downloads. Many people cannot afford paid marketing as it will cost a lot of money to advertise.\nApp Store Analytics\nIf you want to know if your app is doing well, you can link your app to an analytics tool. It will track your app and provide you with great insights of where you are lacking and in what segments you are doing well. You can find a lot of app analytic tools these days that can carry various functions. App Annie and MobileDevHQ are a few of the favorite mobile app analytics tools that you can find in the market.\nFeature in App Review Sites\nThere is a very high percentage of downloads that only happen after the app review sites give good feedback about the app. Now, this might include tech news, mainstream media, and niche related sites. Identify those blog sites and authors applicable to your app and approach them to see if they can publish an article or two about your app.\nPitching to a journalist is hard. One rule that you need to follow is to put yourselves in the shoes of the author. Some like to write popular articles while other focus on breaking news. Offer them something that they are more likely to be interested in.\nBuilding an app is never an easy thing and marketing it can be even more difficult. You need to use a multi-faceted approach that is coherent and coordinated to become successful. Besides creating a terrific app, put in time and effort to market in all the possible channels to become successful. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

It offers multiple paradigms such as object-orientation, structural and functional programming that are used in software development. The best part about this scripting language is that you can use it in cross-platform operating systems with ease.\nDevelopers can use it to create a wide range of web applications, including those intended for text and image processing. Some of the most popular websites globally developed using Python are BitTorrent, YouTube, Dropbox, Cinema 4D, Bazaar, and Deluge.\nIf you are new to Python, you might not realize the range of things you can do with this language.

Some GUI toolkits that you can utilize are wxPython, PyQt, PyGtk.\nDevelopers can use them to create highly functional Graphic User Interface (GUI). 2D imaging software like Inkscape and GIMP use Python. 3D animation packages such as 3ds Max, Cinema 4D, and Maya use Python in variable proportions.\nNumerous scientific and computational applications are built using Python. The power and versatility of Python made it an obvious choice for scientific endeavors. As a result, there are now many complex applications in the area of science:\nSciPy: A collection of packages particularly for mathematics, engineering and science.\nPandas: A library for data analysis and modeling.\nIPython: A powerful shell that you can use for editing and record work sessions. The best part about it is that it also supports visualizations and parallel computing.\nSoftware Carpentry Course: One can learn basic principles and skills for scientific computing and running boot camps. It offers open access to teaching materials.\nNumPy: This tool is beneficial for more complex numerical calculations.\nPython is perhaps best known in the realm of gaming. Often, the first thing that people ask when you’re learning Python is if you’ve made a game yet. It has various modules, libraries, and platforms that can help support game development. PySoy, PyKyra, and Pygame are the frameworks that are available to create new games. Some of the famous games that are developed using Python are Civilization-IV, Vega Strike, and Walt Disney’s Toontown Online.\nWeb Applications and Frameworks\nFrameworks such as CherryPy, Django, Flask, and others are made using Python. Some standard libraries and modules can simplify the tasks related to content management and interaction with databases. Interfacing with various internet protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, FTP, POP and Plone, a content management system, is made easy. Google App Engine is one popular web application that is built using Python.\nBusiness and Enterprise Application\nPython has some fantastic features like special libraries, scalability, extensibility, and syntax that is easily readable. Larger applications can easily be customized using a coding language like Python. The popular web application Reddit was first created using Common Lips but later in 2005 was rewritten using Python. Python also played a significant role in the functionality of YouTube.\nPython is used a lot in Linux distributions. For example, Ubuntu’s Ubiquity Installer, Anaconda Installer from Red Hat Enterprise and Fedora are all written using Python. Gentoo Linux also used Python for Portage, its package management systems.\nLanguage Development\nThe design and module architecture of Python has inspired many to develop other languages incorporating elements from Python. For example, Boo language uses the object model and indentation. The syntax of various other languages, like Apple’s Swift, OCaml, CoffeeScript, and Cobra, are also similar to Python.\nPrototyping\nPython is an accessible language, and you can learn it quickly. Since it is an open source language, you also have the advantage of support from a large community. This makes Python the preferred choice when it comes to prototype development. If you want to develop an initial prototype faster, Python is the best as it is agile, scalable, extensible, and you can easily refactor the codes.\nFrom the time of its inception in 1989, Python grew to become part of a plethora of applications in a wide range of fields, including web-based, graphic designs, apps, and scientific and computational applications.\nEnterprise development favors Python because it is available for all operating systems, such as Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux/UNIX. Python 3.4.3 is built using the existing strengths of the language. There is a drastic improvement in Unicode support among all other new features that it has to offer.\nOnce you understand how versatile and effective Python is, you understand its prevalence. With all the popular applications that were built using Python, you should consider learning Python or incorporating it into your next project. Partnering with a python development company has many advantages to augment your team or start a new project. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

For many mobile app developers, the end of Parse definitely seems to fall into the “bad disruption” camp… at first glance, anyway. Developers who know how to take control of the transition could find themselves with a more robust service and lower costs, using this disruption as a chance to improve efficiency and performance. Zibtek can help.\nParse is Great, And We’re Ready for Greater\nWhen it comes to code-free server-side support for a range of mobile apps, few platforms come close to Parse. From database services to a fully-fleshed API that gave everyone the ability to run sophisticated apps without a lick of server-side coding, Parse helped build out the mobile web like few others.\nThe wind-down and eventual shutdown they’ve announced has thousands of developers scrambling for an alternative. Most of these developers don’t have the in-house expertise needed to complete the transition and set up a successful new backend for their apps. Getting a team together to complete the transition in time, and delivering a self-hosted backend as powerful as anything built on Parse and without a service interruption to users, is a tall order.\nGoing in-house with short-term hires gives that tall order a tall price tag, too.\nZibtek’s team is already in place, and is already familiar with everything needed in a transition from Parse and the creation of a new database and API for your mobile app. Partnering with us for your Parse migration means you can focus on delivering the stellar app experience your users expect while we do all the backend grunt work…and save you a fair chunk of change at the same time.\nWhether you simply need data retrieval and migration or a full backend buildout, our team of international developers managed by US-based project leads can deliver in less time and with far less overhead than your typical third-party developer. You’ll get a custom-built tool tailored to you and your users’ needs. All of the functionality Parse provides and more, all designed expressly for you.\nOf course, we’ll match your new database and/or API to your existing Parse framework and method signatures, so everything continues to work seamlessly—your users and your team will hardly notice the difference, but you’ll have a backend that’s more efficient and completely within your control. We can also build push notification solutions for your own servers, giving you command over everything Parse is phasing out.\nDon’t Just Adapt. Evolve.\nParse is leaving—there’s no changing that. You can do a costly internal migration that achieves the bare minimum needed to keep your app functional, or you can cut costs and improve performance by taking Parse’s exit as an opportunity for your own growth. If the latter sounds more appealing to you, we’d love to help make it a reality. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

If so, it’s natural to have concerns about potential obstacles like communication, quality, and cultural alignment.\nJust ask Zoe.\nAs an entrepreneur who’s funded and grown her company the hard way, Zoe’s always prided herself on being open to new and exciting ideas. But there’s one thing she’s never been able to bring herself to do—broaden her culinary horizons by exploring foreign cuisines.\nOne day, Jess, a potential business partner Zoe hopes to impress, invites her to a trendy restaurant specializing only in exotic international dishes. As she scans the menu, Zoe doesn’t recognize a single item, let alone one she wants to try. Anxiety sets in as she worries about potential sensitivities, using the wrong utensils, or pronouncing the dish’s name wrong when she orders.\nAfter a quick “I’ll have the same,” she waits anxiously for the food to arrive. In the meantime, Jess starts raving about how she’ll love their choices. He talks enthusiastically about the health benefits of certain ingredients, how the chef carefully curates each dish, and the incredible way everything comes together to create an unforgettable meal.\nFast forward to picking up the check, and Zoe’s thrilled to find she’s taken an important first step in moving past a long-held mindset.\nOffshore Software Development: Trying Something New\nThe fear of trying something unfamiliar is a common human trait. Call it trepidation, bias, or plain old heebie-jeebies; it can keep us from discovering and embracing countless opportunities that enrich our personal and professional lives.\nOutsourcing Software Development to India - How to Find and Manage the Best International Talent\nOutsourcing software development to international talent has become a norm for companies looking to harness global expertise. However, many CIOs, CTOs, and project managers still carry unconscious biases about outsourcing to countries like India, thinking they’ll have to:\nSacrifice quality for cost.\nOvercome exhausting communication and collaboration hurdles.\nDeal with cultural differences that create insurmountable barriers.\nAccept a loss of control over their project.\nWe firmly believe that overcoming the fear of the unknown is made a whole lot easier by learning the facts, challenging negative assumptions, and gaining a more balanced perspective.\nWhy Do Companies Outsource Software Development To India?\nIndia, with its rich pool of skilled professionals and cost-effective solutions, is considered the #1 country for outsourcing software development.\nTo understand why, let’s counterattack the above biases one by one:\n1. Sacrificing Quality for Cost-Savings\nThe misconception that outsourcing to India translates to a low-quality product doesn’t reflect the reality. While it’s true cost-efficiency is a driving factor for outsourcing to India, the country’s reputation as a hub for IT excellence is hard-earned and well-deserved. Indian software engineers consistently demonstrate exceptional capabilities in delivering high-quality software solutions that meet or exceed industry standards.\nThat makes it critical to evaluate potential outsourcing partners based on their track record, expertise, and dedication to quality rather than make assumptions based on geographical location.\n2. Communication and Collaboration Will Be 10x More Difficult\nLet’s not kid ourselves—every software development project comes with communication and collaboration challenges, no matter where the work is done. Yes, you’ll be working across time zones, but it’s not as big a hurdle as you might think. That’s because while the US has six time zones, India only has one, meaning the country is only 11-1/2 hours ahead of Utah.\nAs to other communication worries like language, technological advancements have made bridging the gap easier than ever. Qualified India-based software development companies recognize the importance of seamless communication and adopt tools and practices that ensure constant connectedness.\n3. Cultural Differences are Insurmountable\nCultural differences undoubtedly influence work dynamics, but that doesn’t mean they can’t be overcome. Time and again we’ve seen how cross-cultural collaborations foster innovation and fresh perspectives, enriching a project rather than hindering it.\n4. Losing Control Over Projects\nAgain, the fear of losing control is common to most outsourced projects. This concern typically stems from a bias rooted in the need for direct oversight. However, a well-established and trustworthy outsourcing partner like Zibtek offers transparent project management processes that allow you to stay informed and engaged at each step. Rather than fixate on control, it helps to shift the focus towards building trust and preserving open communication, both of which can yield positive outcomes.\nOutsourcing Software Development to India - How to Find and Manage the Best International Talent\nOther reasons companies outsource software development to India include:\nScalability. India-based developers are typically tooled up to quickly scale teams to accommodate changing project requirements, something especially helpful for companies with fluctuating workloads.\nAdvanced tech infrastructures. India’s significant investment in the latest technology infrastructures and facilities is a major factor in placing it at the top of the outsourcing list. First-rate Indian software development companies have state-of-the-art technologies and tools that efficiently handle even the most complex projects.\nGlobal presence. Many India-based development companies have a global presence, working with clients from diverse industries. This experience allows them to adapt to various business cultures and practices.\nA Brief Cost-Benefit Analysis\nThe main objective of any outsourcing endeavor is cost-cutting and hiring skilled talent for a particular job. Elements for comparison include everything from wages and resource availability to post-development support and infrastructure development.\nThis concise cost-benefit analysis shows why India supersedes the US in IT outsourcing.\nLower labor costs. Outsourcing to India generally results in lower labor costs, leading to significant budget savings.\nReduced overhead. You don’t need to invest in additional office space, equipment, or in-house infrastructure.\nNo recruitment expenses. Hiring and onboarding new team members can be expensive and time-consuming. Outsourcing bypasses these expenses, as your outsource partner handles them.\nMajor players like Slack, Microsoft, Skype, and Alibaba have long taken advantage of offshore development centers that allow them to enhance their workforces and products. Smaller companies can enjoy the same benefits while generating better revenue opportunities for their businesses.\nHow Do I Manage The Geographical, Time Zone, and Cultural Conflicts That Can Accompany Outsourcing?\nThe short and perhaps surprising answer is to see them as advantages.\nFor instance, time zone differences give you the advantage of work being carried out round-the-clock. When your team in India logs off for the day, your in-house team can begin to review the work and share feedback that your offshore engineers can get started on once your developers head home.\nAnd as mentioned earlier, collaboration with diverse teams often leads to innovative solutions, as does being exposed to different markets and practices.\nHow Zibtek and OnDemand Workforce Are Revolutionizing Outsourcing\nZibtek is excited to announce the launch of a new program designed to help our clients hire the right people more efficiently. OnDemand Workforce allows you to take advantage of all the best practices we’ve learned at Zibtek here in Utah while also leveraging the talents of our operations and recruiting staff in Bangalore, who can help you quickly find the niche talent you need for your project.\nReach out today to learn more about this innovative approach to outsourcing or to schedule a meeting.

    "extractedText": "CUSTOM SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT\nPayment Gateway vs. Payment Processor\nIan J.H Reynolds\nExplore Ian J.H Reynolds' expertise in finance and economics through his insightful articles on market trends, investment strategies, and economic analysis.\nMore posts by Ian J.H Reynolds.\nIAN J.H REYNOLDS\n5 JUN 2020 • 7 MIN READ\nOnline payments processing can be confusing, particularly for those who are just taking their business online. There are quite a few things that they need to wrap their head around and that can often be easier said than done.\nOne of the things that people struggle with the most is the differentiation between a payment gateway and payment processor. Both are vital links of the online payment processing chain, but it’s important to truly understand the differences between the two.\nWhat is a payment gateway?\nThe simplest explanation of a payment gateway is that it's a technology which allows merchants, a.k.a business owners like yourself, to accept debit or credit card purchases from customers. It would otherwise not be possible to extend this payment option to customers.\nPayment gateways aren't exclusively used online. The physical card-reading machines and Point-of-Sale terminals that come integrated with them are payment gateways as well. They allow brick and mortar retailers to accept payments via debit and credit cards.\nThe payment gateways used by physical retail stores have actually got much smarter over the years. As mobile payments systems like Apple Pay and Samsung Pay have gained momentum, the payment gateway providers have adapted by releasing new terminals that can accept mobile payments from these Near Field Communication or NFC-based mobile payments services.\nThe implementation is slightly different for online stores. Payment gateways are basically the checkout portals that you come across online when shopping for things. You enter your card information in the portal which is then processed by a service PayPal or Stripe.\nPros\nThere are quite a few advantages of using an online payment gateway. Security is perhaps the biggest advantage. A payment gateway ensures that the card details, which is highly sensitive information, is passed securely from the customer to the merchant and from the merchant to the payment processor.\nStrong encryption has become an absolute necessity as hackers have resorted to more notorious ways of stealing payment information. Some of the most widely used payment gateways offer robust security to ensure that your customers’ data is transmitted safely and that your business doesn’t end up being on the hook due to data leaks.\nAnother excellent advantage of payment gateways is that they allow business owners to significantly expand their customer base. Your business can easily accept payments from customers across the globe with everything related to processing and currency conversion being handled by the payments processor.\nMany payment gateway solutions now offer shopping cart integration as well. The digital interpretation of a shopping card is the system that your customers use to select one or multiple products from your website and then pay for it. The shopping cart is essentially the funnel that guides them through the checkout process, helping them along the way by calculating shipping fees and taxes for them.\nCons\nNothing can ever be without risk and the same holds true for online payments processing. While payment gateway providers make significant investments in security, there have been instances where data leaks have resulted in the sensitive information of customers being exposed.\nSince a payment gateway is basically a software, any technical glitch in the software can take quite some time to resolve. It can be doubly frustrating if you're not technically skilled enough to understand what the issue might be or if the payment gateway you have chosen doesn't provide great customer service.\nThe charges and fees can often be prohibitive, so much so that they may take out a significant chunk of the profit margin. If your business operates on razor thin margins, it can ill afford to have so much of its profits being eaten up by fees.\nWhat is a payment processor?\nAs the name suggests, a payment processor is the service that quite literally processes the payment for you. It will communicate and relay the information from your customers card to your bank and your customer's bank. If the customer has enough funds on their card, the transaction will go through and the amount will reflect in your account. Keep in mind that all of this happens in real-time and in seconds.\nPayment processors also keep an eye on fraudulent transactions as they have stringent security measures in place. It will also handle chargebacks and refunds, though it's often at a cost to your business rather than the customer, but that's just the cost of doing business.\nPros\nA payment processor offers you a quick and easy way to start accepting payments on your website without having to obtain your own merchant acquiring account and setting up costly payments processing infrastructure.\nThe ease and convenience is what allows so many small business owners to get up and running in no time. You can sign up for a payment processor and be ready to launch your online business in hours.\nThe fraud detection tools that major payment processors have provide a great disadvantage. They can help you weed out potentially fraudulent sales that may have been made using stolen cards. It’s just one less thing for you to worry about.\nCons\nThe fees are undoubtedly one of the biggest advantages of using a payments processor. They’re generally on the higher side and it’s usually not until your business has grown big enough and processes a significant amount of transactions that you can get them to lower the fees.\nYou may also need to take a hit on currency conversion rates if you sell products and services in different currencies. Your payments processor will enable you to accept multiple currencies, but they may offer you a bad conversion rate when the time comes to actually access your funds.\nIf you’re using a payment processing aggregator like PayPal, they may also be wary of certain types of businesses. As it stands, these companies don’t generally like to take on a lot of risk so it may happen that your business idea might be considered too risky and you may be denied an account so your business may not even get off the ground.\nEven if you are approved initially, they may place holds on the funds in your account or even unilaterally ban your account if they feel that your business is no longer in compliance with their terms of service, and then there’s little room for you to reason with them and get your account reinstated. This effectively leaves you out to dry until you can find an alternative payment processing solution.\nWhich one should you choose?\nBy now you will have understood that payment gateways are most commonly used to accept payments. With the rise of ecommerce, it has now become vital to offer customers a seamless buying experience through all of the different channels that you utilize to reach out to them.\nThat’s what payment gateways allow you to do in addition to allow you to integrate payments with your accounting or CRM software so that you can keep a close eye on the sales data.\nIf you only need to accept card payments at a point of sale terminal in a physical retail location, you typically don't require a payment gateway. That’s because the actual card would be inserted into the terminal or a randomized token will be used by one of the mobile payments services.\nYou’re most definitely going to need both a payment gateway and a payment processor if you want to accept payments from customers online. Think of it this way: the payment gateway is what will encrypt and move the card information from your customer to the payment processor and the payment processor would then utilize the information to move the funds from their card to your account.\nGet you a software development service that can do both.\nIt can often seem to be quite challenging to figure out the implementation challenges with payment gateways and processors, particularly if you’d like a more custom implementation for your business.\nAccurate payments data can help you further grow your business as you can track many different data points to make crucial changes that help drive growth and reduce costs. All of this can only be made possible by robust integration of these vital components.\nZibtek is one of the world’s leading software development companies and it’s highly experienced in helping business owners integrate payment gateways and processors.

    "extractedText": "CUSTOM SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT\n5 Reasons Why You Need A Dedicated Development Team\nIan J.H Reynolds\nExplore Ian J.H Reynolds' expertise in finance and economics through his insightful articles on market trends, investment strategies, and economic analysis.\nMore posts by Ian J.H Reynolds.\nIAN J.H REYNOLDS\n24 APR 2020 • 6 MIN READ\nIt’s not feasible for a lot of companies, particularly startups, to have an in-house software development team. There are significant costs involved and companies that have a limited financial runway can often not afford to have an internal team. That’s why many prefer outsourcing the work but to a dedicated team.\nEven if they have the resources to maintain an in-house team, this is also a great option for companies that are looking to reduce their costs. If they can see that outsourcing the work to an external team can work for them, many companies would prefer moving to this model as it helps deliver considerable savings.\nThe dedicated development team model is essentially an agreement between the client and the service provider. The latter commits to providing software development professionals that only work on the client's projects. These professionals are selected based on the demands of the client and either the service provider can assign a project manager to manage the team or the client may decide to do it from their side.\nBefore you do decide to shift your company to this model, you need to have a good grasp of the reasons why this move will help your business in the long run. Here are the five reasons why a dedicated software development team might be beneficial for your business.\nThere are 5 reasons you need a dedicated software development team:\nAccess to more skilled resources\nIf you have an in-house software development team, your technology stack capabilities will be limited by the number of people that have been hired. New people need to be hired in the event that more technological capabilities are required.\nThis is often easier said than done. Going through the entire recruitment process, shortlisting candidates, interviewing them, extending offers and then finally having them join the team wastes valuable time that could have been spent improving the technology stack.\nNot to mention the fact that having additional full-time employees places more strain on the finances of your company. You’ll need to offer attractive salaries and benefits so that they choose to join your company and not your competitors. All of this can be mitigated by having a dedicated software development team in place.\nAn outsourced team that's dedicated to your projects gives you access to the global talent pool. It increases the scalability of your project since you can tell the service provider what resources you require and they can immediately assign people from their pool to your project.\nSince these developers will be paid on the actual number of hours or days that they work on your project, this is a more cost effective solution. You can easily scale up or down based on the project requirement with considerably less time and financial burden.\nYou also have a much better idea of how much the resources for a particular project are going to cost you. Terminating full-time employees can be a costly affair while an external team is often only hired on a per-project basis, so there’s no need to continue paying for it once the job has been done.\nIncreased reliability and efficiency\nDedicated team service providers have to face a lot of competition in the market. Only those that can offer extremely efficient and reliable service have a chance of retaining clients for long-term projects.\nTo ensure that they can provide the best possible service to clients, these companies have lean operations and can promise greater efficiency and reliability. Having them work on your project provides you with access to their highly optimized processes and their vast pool of talent.\nSo while this means that you’ll have a lot of options to choose from when you start looking for a service provider, it also means that you’ll need to be mindful of the company that you pick.\nYou’d want to see what their track record is, whether they have previously worked with clients in your industry, and if they have a big enough talent pool to support all of the requirements for your project.\nSince providing exceptional service to clients is vital for their business, these service providers also have robust reporting and evaluation procedures set up. They'll enable you to monitor the progress on your project in real time and evaluate whether the work that's being done is completely in line with your expectations.\nFaster turnaround time\nHow quickly your in-house development team can turnaround new projects depends on the size of the team. It will have to manage work on new projects alongside maintaining existing software. This can often present challenges when it comes to new projects.\nYour employees can only do so much. If they’re trying to split their time between new projects and their regular work, chances are that they might not be able to do a good enough job on both fronts.\nEven if you have an in-house team, having a dedicated external team will take the pressure off of them and they can continue work on their ongoing tasks without having to juggle them with new projects.\nThe dedicated team will be purely focused on the new project so they will be able to provide a much faster turnaround while also ensuring a higher level of quality compared to an in-house team that’s trying to be the jack of all trades.\nNo equipment investment required\nIf you have a special software development project, chances are that you may need to provide your team of developers with new equipment. That could be in the form of new hardware or software tools that are crucial to getting the job done.\nYour business would absolutely be on the hook for these expenses should the need arise to supply new equipment to the in-house development team. This means that a significant investment would be required even before work on the new project can be started.\nThis will not be a concern for you with a dedicated software development team. It’s entirely the software provider’s job to make sure that the developers working on your project have all of the right tools and hardware that they need to get the job done. Whether that's powerful new workstations or licenses for software that's not open source, the service provider won't ask you to foot the bill for any of those items.\nMore flexibility for the in-house team\nIf the nature of your business requires that you maintain both an internal and a dedicated development team, outsourcing work to free up your in-house team for other purposes can prove to be beneficial as well.\nFor example, if you’re working on a new software and would like the intellectual property to remain within the company, you could shift a lot of the routine tasks to a dedicated development team so that your employees can entirely focus on the latest project.\nThis model proves to be very useful particularly if your development team comes into the office everyday so it’s possible for you to personally oversee the progress. That’s not an option with a dedicated team which is only going to work remotely.\nAny routine tasks such as fixing bugs or pushing incremental feature updates on existing software can be handled by the dedicated team while your in-house developers work on the next big thing.\nGet the most dedicated development team you can with Zibtek.\nYou can only reap the benefits of moving to a dedicated development team model if you find the right service provider. The market is indeed highly competitive and there are a lot of contenders vying for your business, not the quality of service can vary immensely from one company to the next.\nOffshore service providers may be able to offer more attractive rates but your experience with them can vary. It could also be difficult to truly have oversight over the team that’s working on your project. Furthermore, offshore companies may not fall within the legal jurisdiction of where your company is based, so this could end up being a problem if any intellectual property issues arise.\nThat's why Zibtek is highly regarded as one of the world's leading software development companies. It provides software, security, and advisory solutions for some of the world's biggest companies and startups alike. Zibtek has executed projects in dozens of industries from real-estate to healthcare, leveraging emerging technologies like Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things.\nIt can provide the most dedicated development team to work on your project. The team is driven by the market to offer quality service and the company is structured to allow its clients to significantly accelerate their efforts beyond the experience and capacity of their internal teams.\nBased in the United States, Zibtek offers a truly global talent pool from which to draw resources from for your project.

    "extractedText": "ERP\nFive Things Healthcare Companies Need to Know About ERP Systems\nIan J.H Reynolds\nExplore Ian J.H Reynolds' expertise in finance and economics through his insightful articles on market trends, investment strategies, and economic analysis.\nMore posts by Ian J.H Reynolds.\nIAN J.H REYNOLDS\n2 JAN 2020 • 5 MIN READ\nThe healthcare industry is one of the most complex business verticals there is. Not only must you manage everything a regular business must deal with: inventory, internal communication, scheduling, etc—but you must do it securely and error-free since you are dealing with people’s health.\nPatients require modern solutions for their healthcare needs. They want a seamless real-time experience that lets them schedule appointments, message their doctors, order medications, view their medical records, and pay their bills all through one application. On top of this functionality, the application must be secure to protect patient privacy.\nDelivering technology with modern workflows that also prioritizes security concerns is difficult to do, which is why so many healthcare companies—particularly in the United States—are behind the times.\nFortunately, there is a perfect solution. Enterprise resource planning (ERP) software can manage all aspects of a healthcare business. It automates administrative tasks and manual labor and identifies weak points in processes and overspending, ordering and managing inventory, scheduling, payroll, and even medical records. If you operate an e-commerce site, a healthcare enterprise ERP for ecommerce can reduce operational costs and make your retail operations more efficient. Additionally, security that couples with HIPAA compliance is a common integration into ERP systems.\nSurprisingly, less than a third of all hospitals in the United States use an ERP product as of 2016, according to a Black Book ERP survey. In 2019, Black Book published another report saying that 94 percent of US hospitals are considering outsourcing their ERP. This disparity between how many hospitals have a custom ERP versus how many want one indicates a growing need for centralized software to help hospitals take care of patients. What they have now is clearly not working.\nAs a growing number of healthcare companies are considering using an ERP in the near future, it’s important that they understand exactly what an ERP system is and what benefits it can bring to a business. The following is a list of the top five most important things for healthcare companies to know about ERP systems so they can make the best decision.\n1. An ERP provides healthcare providers access to critical patient information.\nDoctors and nurses who attended years of medical school to help patients with their health should not be spending time on administrative tasks and siloed systems. Their main tasks should be spending time with patients to learn about their health, researching, testing, and helping.\nIf a doctor has to log in to multiple software tools to find data about the patient, that’s a problem. If the multiple software tools have conflicting data about the patient, that’s an even bigger problem.\nOn top of that, hospitals are meant to be a place to provide healthcare to people. Outdated systems, like recordkeeping with paper and filing cabinets or old software that relies on a local data center, mean that hospital resources have to be put towards something other than patient care.\nWith an ERP—especially a cloud-based one—hospitals can outsource IT work to another company that specializes in it and instead focus on what they do best: keeping everyone healthy.\n2. ERP systems were originally created for manufacturing companies.\nYou might be wondering why this is important for healthcare companies to know about. Think about a manufacturing company. They must handle everything from vendors, contracts, supply chain, shipping, handling, reporting, accounting, human resources, and so much more. It’s a large, complex system with a lot of moving parts and a focus on supply chain management. Sounds like a hospital, right?\nAt the end of the day, a hospital is a business that handles very similar workflows to a manufacturing company. Hospitals need to order supplies and medicine, schedule patients and doctors, track expenses and revenue, and communicate about all of this internally in a way that keeps patient data protected. Over the years, ERPs have gained other features—HIPAA compliance and integrations with electronic health records (EHRs)—that have made them the perfect software for the job.\n3. Good ERP solutions keep your data safe, secure, and all in one place.\nAn ERP system acts as a centralized location for all data storage related to your company. You can use it to store electronic health records (EHRs), insurance claims, test results, and other patient information. One of the biggest reasons for medical malpractice is a lack of recorded medical information and siloed healthcare data.\nIf doctors have to scan multiple programs to find all of the information they need to help a patient, there is a bigger risk of error. With an ERP, the doctor can view all relevant data about a patient in one place. This will help them figure out the proper diagnoses.\nAdditionally, ERPs can help different locations easily share data about a single patient. For instance, an EHR from the family doctor can be shared with the emergency room doctor instantly when they need it, which helps speed up the care process.\nBe sure to check that the ERP you are using is HIPAA-compliant. HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, guarantees privacy and security of patient protected health information (PHI) and is required for all healthcare organizations by the federal government.\n4. ERP software systems will save you money.\nBecause an ERP system touches all data related to your company, it’s perfectly suited to then help you make important financial decisions. For instance, the ERP could track how many hospital supplies you are ordering each week and then reference the amount still in inventory. After gathering that data for a while, it can tell you the right amount to order so that you don’t run out or have too much. It’s a tool to streamline many aspects of a healthcare organization’s processes (particularly inventory management) and increase operational efficiency.\nModern ERP software solutions are built with data analysis and machine learning technology that can learn your business processes over time so that it can then suggest potential efficiencies and identify weak points, which is a great way to save money. Additionally, ERPs come with the ability to produce reports to help you visualize your business.\n5. ERP systems reduce errors.\nWhile errors in business are never good, errors in healthcare can be fatal. That’s why preventing mistakes is a top priority for healthcare companies. Cloud ERPs are a great way to stop mistakes that come from human error, data silos, and miscommunication.\nSince all patient data is stored in digital form in a centralized database of the ERP, human errors on patient records are almost completely eradicated. These digital records can be built with form checking to prevent wrongly-entered data as well. They also eliminate the problem of sloppy handwriting, a trope amongst doctors.\nKeeping all patient data in one location is the best way to defeat data silos. When doctors can instantly view all information about a patient in one place, it saves them time and gives them an overhead view of the patient’s health. Who knows, maybe an old copy of an x-ray from two years ago will end up helping the doctor with their diagnoses.\nAre you ready for an ERP?\nIf these benefits sound like a great way to improve your healthcare business, then you’re in luck! Zibtek is experienced in delivering high-quality, custom healthcare ERP systems that are HIPAA compliant. When it comes to a piece of software and management system this crucial to the operations of a hospital or other healthcare facility, it’s important to use the very best providers.\nReach out to talk to us and get a free quote.

    "extractedText": "ERP\nERP and Cybersecurity Checklist: How to Safely Integrate Software Applications\nIan J.H Reynolds\nExplore Ian J.H Reynolds' expertise in finance and economics through his insightful articles on market trends, investment strategies, and economic analysis.\nMore posts by Ian J.H Reynolds.\nIAN J.H REYNOLDS\n17 DEC 2019 • 4 MIN READ\nEnterprise resource planning (ERP) software is highly valuable to companies because it acts as a centralized location to store, access, and manipulate business data. Sometimes, the data that is stored is highly sensitive or contains protected consumer information, like financial or personal data. This confidential information is exactly what hackers break into systems to get.\nIn 2018 a report was released by Digital Shadows, a digital risk management firm, and Onapsis, an ERP cybersecurity and compliance firm, that detailed findings about attacks on business systems around the world. They identified thousands of security vulnerabilities in ERP software from big companies like Oracle and SAP. The number of vulnerabilities becomes even more worrisome when combined with the fact that the report also found a 160 percent increase in “the activity and interest in ERP-specific vulnerabilities” in just one year.\nVulnerability assessment: Who is most at risk?\nThere’s a lot of data in a world where everything from toasters to mailboxes is “smart.” Not all data is of equal value, either. Software login passwords are more sensitive and valuable than whatever data a smart toaster is logging.\nCompanies that specialize in healthcare have some of the most valuable data to attackers. Reuters claims that “Your medical information is worth 10 times more than your credit card number on the black market.” This is because hackers can use health information to file false claims to insurance companies and purchase drugs and medical equipment for resale on the black market.\nFinancial companies are also extremely vulnerable to attacks and security threats. If hackers gain access to the personally identifiable information (PII) that most banks keep about their customers, such as social security numbers (SSN), they can easily use it to steal identities. Additionally, attackers might try to gain access to customers’ bank accounts and credit cards.\nA 2018 report by the Ponemon Institute about the state of cybersecurity in small & medium size businesses found that 67 percent of the companies they surveyed experienced a cyber attack in the past year. On average, those companies spent $1.43 million on the aftermath of cyberattacks, which is 33 percent higher than the previous year.\nThis is why it’s more important than ever to make security and cyber threat intelligence top priorities for your ERP.\nWhat causes ERP systems to be vulnerable?\nThe most common ERP mistakes come from human error, such as poor planning and using out-of-the-box solutions without considering your specific needs. ERP systems also have inherent challenges.\nThe systems are complex. Large systems, particularly out-of-the-box enterprise-grade ones, tend to be extremely complicated. As these systems are built to handle many use cases for thousands of customers, the code becomes enormously complex. Elaborate systems often create errors unforeseen by the developers.\nThere are many users. Because many data breaches are the result of human negligence, every new user increases the risk of attack. Employees tend to be careless with passwords, sometimes choosing overly simple ones or storing them out in the open. Cybercriminals can even trick people into telling them their credentials through the use of phishing or banking trojans.\nLack of a security champion. If no one is driving security as a software requirement, then it is unlikely to be given the proper attention. Security champions are people who will learn about ERP security, identify vulnerabilities, and stay up-to-date on the best practices for preventing cyber attacks. Without someone leading the effort (like a chief information security officer or CISO), security flaws are bound to go unnoticed.\nFortunately, there are simple steps that you can follow to safeguard your business against cyber attacks.\nERP security checklist\n▢ Update software with recent security patches\nIt’s way too easy to ignore notifications that tell you to update your software. Unfortunately, this creates a huge vulnerability that hackers love to take advantage of. Software updates are important because they often include critical security patches that are necessary to keep your systems safe. Patching is generally the result of providers discovering security flaws through audits or breaches. Keeping up-to-date is one of the easiest ways to keep the cyber attackers at bay.\nDon’t forget that firewalls, antivirus, and anti-malware software should be installed and kept updated as well.\n▢ Control access to your ERP using permission levels\nYour ERP application should allow you to give different users varying levels of access to data and sensitive information in your program. Be sure that only the users who need the data—and are certified to access it—are able to get it.\nThis is especially important for healthcare-related systems. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) comprises “national standards for the protection of certain health information.” A violation of HIPAA means you are breaking the law.\n▢ Establish and enforce password policies\nIt’s important to establish a clear password policy and require employees to follow it. This should include rules like:\nDo not share your password with anyone.\nDo not write your password down anywhere.\nDo not use a simple or easy-to-guess password.\nOnly use passwords once.\nOnly use passwords with 15+ characters, at least two numbers, and one special symbol.\nChange your password every three months.\nYou can also enforce extra security measures, such as two-factor authentication and single sign-on (SSO).\n▢ Conduct regular security audits\nWhile it is challenging to test systems for vulnerabilities and impossible to detect them all, it’s still important to do regular audits. Once you have selected a security champion (or a team of security champions), have them periodically check the system. Unfortunately, there are not a lot of automated tools to complete ERP security testing yet due to the complex nature of the software, so manual testing must be done.\n▢ Enforce encryption for remote and onsite workers\nEmployees that work from home or anywhere on a network that could be vulnerable may open up your system to attacks. Be sure to require encryption and a VPN for remote workers.\nHow does custom software help?\nLarge ERP solutions that are built for countless customers who make complicated customizations present enormous security flaws. Fortunately, there are other options.\nCustom software is much easier to keep secure because it is built with only one customer in mind. This keeps the code far less complex than out-of-the-box software.\nAdditionally, custom software can be created to meet your business processes and specific security needs. For instance, if your company specializes in healthcare then HIPAA compliance can be a key deliverable.\nIf you’re interested in hearing more about how Zibtek prioritizes security in every project, reach out for a quick chat or free consultation.

    "extractedText": "HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY\nCustom Healthcare Software: What, Why, and How\nIan J.H Reynolds\nExplore Ian J.H Reynolds' expertise in finance and economics through his insightful articles on market trends, investment strategies, and economic analysis.\nMore posts by Ian J.H Reynolds.\nIAN J.H REYNOLDS\n13 DEC 2019 • 5 MIN READ\nTake a moment and think back to the last time you visited the doctor.\nYou probably scheduled your appointment online or through an app. When the nurses at the front desk checked you in, they most likely looked you up on their computer. You may have filled out a paper form, but if your doctor’s office is futuristic perhaps you filled out the form on a tablet.\nThe room where the doctor saw you had a computer. The doctor probably logged into it while they were with you. They might have typed some notes about you, looked at past medical records, or sent a prescription to your pharmacy.\nYour whole visit was covered by technological healthcare solutions that helped you get appropriate care and keep your medical data private.\nWhat is custom healthcare software?\nTo define custom healthcare software, we must first define custom software. Custom software is software that is built specifically for one company, to meet their clearly defined business goals. To read more about custom software, how much it can cost, and what it can do for a business, take a look at this article.\nCustom healthcare software is any software that is custom-made for a company in the healthcare industry to help them conduct business.\nWhat are some common types of healthcare software?\nHealthcare software is a broad field that includes everything from practice management solutions to software for rendering 3D medical images (DICOM). The list below highlights some common custom healthcare software tools. While they don’t cover every kind of healthcare-related technology, they’re a good place to start.\nElectronic health record (EHR)\nThe best way for medical providers to keep track of patient information is with an EHR (also sometimes called an electronic medical record or EMR). HealthIT.gov defines an EHRs “real-time, patient-centered records that make information available instantly and securely to authorized users.” It includes information about “medical history, diagnoses, medications, treatment plans, immunization dates, allergies, radiology images, and laboratory and test results.”\nDoctors love EHRs because they make it easier to get a deeper understanding of their patients by providing more data. In fact, according to a 2012 study, 75 percent of medical professionals reported that the use of EHRs enabled them to give better care to their patients.\nPharmacy\nA pharmacy is basically a complex retail environment. There is product inflow, wholesale contracts, inventory, patient management, and medication lists to manage. There are also laws about controlled substances and patient privacy. Custom healthcare software can help pharmacies track patients and medications, streamline processes, and keep them in step with the law.\nAdditionally, healthcare providers need an efficient way to securely send electronic prescriptions to pharmacies. Often this is an integration with the EHR so that the doctor only has to use one program.\nHospital management systems\nThis may go without saying, but hospitals—or any healthcare organization, for that matter—are not easy to manage. On top of all the medical challenges, there are myriad administrative tasks that must be taken care of. Such tasks might include scheduling of nurses and doctors, facilitating communication between the doctor and patient, medical billing and insurance, and inventory of medical supplies.\nRevenue cycle management software\nWhile the care and keeping of patients come first, healthcare facilities are still businesses and therefore have finances to think about. Medical staff need a simple way to verify insurance, send bills, follow up on payments, process claims, and analyze data to get an overall fiscal view.\nA system that is integrated with a patient portal can do things like check a patient’s insurance eligibility automatically as they make an appointment or deliver a paperless bill with an easy online payment portal.\nTelemedicine\nSome doctors offer the ability to remotely video conference a visit instead of requiring the patient to travel all the way to the office. This can be a great benefit for those really sick or unable to travel to the doctor. These systems must be able to securely provide face-to-face conferencing, screen sharing, and image transmission.\nThat’s only the start of telemedicine. With recent advancements in technology, doctors can now carry out some patient monitoring and even patient care at home instead of in the hospital. Telehealth solutions can include the use of heart monitors, glucose monitors, wearable tech, mobile apps, and much more.\nWhat makes healthcare software so complicated?\nBy now you may have noticed the continuous use of the word “secure” in relation to patient data. This is due to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, also known as HIPAA. Medical operations are subject to strict privacy laws that are meant to protect patient medical information.\nMedical providers are required by federal law to give every patient a notice of privacy practices (NPP) and to provide a way for patients to access their protected health information (PHI), change their PHI, be told about disclosures of their PHI, enact restrictions on the use of their PHI, and hold solely confidential communications.\nSince healthcare software deals with enormous amounts of PHI, it’s incredibly important that any custom software or healthcare application that is built for your company takes HIPAA compliance incredibly seriously. There’s an entire chapter in the Guide to Privacy and Security of Electronic Health Information that is devoted to cybersecurity. It must be considered at every step of the development process.\nWhy use custom healthcare software?\nCustom healthcare software improves customer experience. Your patients will get a seamless and user-friendly experience from scheduling appointments to paying their bills and accessing their medical records online. When patients find it easy to get medical attention, they’re more likely to get the help they need. In the long term, this means a healthier society.\nCustom healthcare is tailor-made for your business. Custom healthcare software development is better than out-of-the-box solutions because it takes into consideration each organization's needs—number of locations, size of operations, services and products offered, audience demographics, and any additional business requirements. While there may be out-of-the-box solutions that “kind of” fit your business model, custom software is built just for you.\nCustom healthcare software comes with a personal support team. Out-of-the-box healthcare software may have a support line that you can call, but the support staff will never be familiar with your particular situation. Custom software solutions come with a team of engineers and designers who will become intimately familiar with your organization's operations as they build your solution. When you call for assistance, you’ll be more than just an account number. You’ll have a development team of experts who know your unique solution, ready to help.\nGetting started\nWhether your healthcare business is big or small, if you care about creating a seamless experience for your patients, protecting their data, and improving their quality of care then custom healthcare software is the right choice for you. You just need to find the right software development company.\nIf you’re interested, talk to us at Zibtek.

    "extractedText": "CRM\n7 Reasons Why You Should Build a Custom CRM System\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n26 APR 2019 • 6 MIN READ\nAbout CRM\nA Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system aims to streamline your business process by improving the relationship with existing customers and identifying new leads and possibilities. It facilitates collecting, storing and managing customer information, customer segmentation, sales automation, campaign management, etc.\nCRMs are not only for large-scale businesses with vast databases of customers but they are also beneficial for small and medium-sized businesses. If you want to expand your business, then Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software is essential. According to Nucleus research, “CRM users experience an $8.71 return on every dollar of their CRM investment.”\nYou need a CRM system to grow with you as your business grows. Considering this, you should build light-weight and effective customized CRM instead of investing tons of money into a complicated ready-made CRM software.\nBelow are the top 7 reasons to build your own custom CRM:\n1. Less expensive than ready-made CRM\nReady-made CRM plans and cost\nMost of the ready-made CRM systems come as SaaS products on a subscription basis. The amount they charge is based on the number of users in your organization and the available features. But these plans have a certain set of limitations, since many pre-packaged CRM solutions come with features you may never need and might lack one or two features that might prove useful to you. And once your business grows, such plans become inadequate.\nStarter plans only support a few users and miss some critical features. To get all the essential capabilities of CRM, at some point, enterprises switch to a more expensive plan.\nBut CRM costs will continue to grow over time. Its cost depends on the number of users accessing the system in your organization. Here are a few examples that will give you some context:\nEach employee you hire in the sales and marketing department needs daily access to the CRM system to track leads, create advertising campaigns and plan activities.\nCustomer support team members need to check the CRM to view customer information occasionally.\nTo get an overview of projects, management people need to access the CRM system to view reports.\nTo enhance the effectiveness and functionalities of business, enterprises often end up paying for all the features a ready-made CRM system offers.\nCustom CRM cost\nIf you are running a mid-size or large-size business, then a custom CRM system can be cheaper than a ready-made solution. You can build your custom CRM using both pre-programmed and custom apps that fit your requirements.\nThe custom CRM costs depend on the following:\nNumber of features you want to add\nTheir technical complexities\nDeveloper experience\nNon-functional requirements (e.g. reliability, security)\nCost comparison between ready-made CRM and custom CRM\nLet’s calculate the cost of a ready-made CRM subscription:\nSuppose you are running a mid-size business with 25+ employees. Your CRM business package costs $125 per user per month.\n25 users X $125 = $3,125 per month = $37,500 per year = $187,500 for 5 years.\nWith the same amount of money, you can customize a more advanced CRM system for your company with potential technical support.\n2. Minimize onboarding time\nA good training and onboarding programme helps recent hires to feel welcome on the job and minimizes the time it takes for them to become productive in their positions. While switching to a new workflow, employees inevitably make mistakes, like missing a call from a client, lose promising deals, etc. Hiring a certified trainer to train your new employees to use enterprise applications can take several months. With the simple UI of a custom CRM solution, you can minimize the lengthy onboarding time and increase the productivity of your employees.\nIn the onboarding process, a custom CRM solution will help you with the following:\nIt is based on existing workflows, making the adjustment easier for new employees.\nIt also decreases the number of mistakes made during the on-boarding period.\nYou can add advanced features that you need for the business and reduce the training expenses.\n3. Simplifies integration\nYou are required to pay a significant fee to get additional benefits for an off-the-shelf CRM system. Their extended functionalities and APIs come in more expensive packages.\nThe integration approach in off-the-shelf CRM complicates the things. You need to hire well-experienced developers with extensive knowledge if you are integrating an off-the-shelf CRM with the following:\nMicrosoft Outlook,\nGmail\nGoogle apps\nAccounting apps (Xero, QuickBooks, etc.)\nInventory and invoicing systems\nCustom ERP tool or other in-house technology\nProject management apps\nBut a custom CRM system makes future integration easier and less expensive by enabling developers to use the API-first approach, making the process more reliable. With custom integrations, your CRM will turn into a central hub for all departments (including HR, project management, finance, supply chain, manufacturing, purchasing, technical support, etc.) and evolve into successful digitization.\n4. Eases scaling process\nTo enhance the automation process and information sharing in your growing business, you need to expand CRM functionality to other departments.\nWhile scaling your business with a ready-made CRM solution, you will face the following issues:\nYou need to buy a more expensive plan, which might not include all the functionalities and features you need for your business.\nYou have to install new add-ons, which come with a hefty price tag.\nYou need to integrate your own extension with the CRM solution.\nIn a custom CRM system, you are the owner of your product. You can make any modifications to the custom CRM that adapts to your unique business process.\nUnlike a ready-made CRM, a custom CRM provides the following benefits:\nYou can add any number of users without paying any additional cost.\nYou can customize extended capabilities like lead management, database management, or augmented analytics.\nYou can make changes according to your business requirements.\n5. Increasing automation process\nMany off-the-shelf CRM systems lack automation. They require sales managers to spend a lot of time on data entry. At some point, sales-people might feel that they are wasting their time doing things manually that could be automated, like:\nEntering customer information manually in the database.\nCompiling data\nUploading recorded calls of customers\nTracking customer replies\nAs a result, they won’t use the CRM system wholly, no matter how much you have paid for it.\nWith a custom CRM solution, you can save a significant amount of time and money by automating the functionalities you need for your business. For example:\nAutomating customer support to send faster responses to customer queries and managing regular customer inquiries.\nAutomating daily sales-related activities, like tracking deals and monthly revenues, account and billing management, etc.\nAutomating follow-up emails after calls.\nAutomating the data entry process.\nAutomating lead management, like collecting emails, basic information, web behavior, etc.\n6. Resolved data migration issues\nSometimes, lack of scalability, a limited number of supported applications, high maintenance cost and lack of configuring capabilities are the reasons you want to migrate from an old to a new CRM system.\nBut the technical challenge that you face while making a transition to a new CRM system are:\nMoving old data to the new system without losing information.\nFinding compatible hardware for your CRM system.\nUnderstanding the legacy system.\nIf you migrate to a ready-made CRM solution, you might need to hire specialists to extract, parse and standardize the necessary data, before moving to a new CRM. This will be an expensive approach.\nBut if you are migrating to a custom CRM system, these technical challenges can be addressed (with lower cost) by the development team in the following ways:\nThey design the target CRM system for more seamless migration.\nThey set up the new CRM with a compatible format.\nThey create a migration script that prevents data loss.\nFor high scalability, low maintenance cost, more efficient and high performance, it’s usually better to migrate to a new custom CRM solution.\n7. Enhancing custom features\nMost ready-made CRMs provide a generic solution for your business, as they are designed for a wide range of companies. Such CRMs might not fit your business if your workflow is unique or you have special business requirements.\nWhereas, a custom CRM is built especially to serve your business needs. It helps your enterprise in the following ways:\nIt provides you a complete solution that fully satisfies your requirements.\nIt excludes the unnecessary features that you don’t require for your business, saving storage space for the applications.\nIt can automate your analytics and reporting capabilities according to your business logic.\nNote\nIf you have never used a CRM system and want to plan your requirements for a future custom CRM system, then you should first try a free CRM solution.

During the early 2000s, designers were building sites without data tables. Now we have come a long way in using data to make some critical decisions. Previously, emotions weren’t seen as having a role in driving traffic to the site or in increasing page views, sales or video plays.\nIn that paradigm, the designer’s role was to ensure that people reach from point A to the point B and nothing else. But nowadays, people live much of their lives online. And hence we are embarking on a new frontier as designers. We are developing or designing frameworks that help people to exist online just like how they do offline.\nAn example of the need for these changes is the instances when people who lost their mothers receive auto messages suggesting that they buy surprise gifts for their mothers on Mother’s Day. While it may be appropriate for those who did not lose their mothers, it can be upsetting for people who have suffered a loss.\nOne thing that people need to remember is that we do not stop being a human the moment we go online. Sometimes, it is possible to hurt a person even when you have the best of intentions. It is essential to understand that all our human emotions come with us when we go online.\nFor many years, designers approached the software as if it was neutral. They gave it a set of instructions that it needs to follow to complete the task. But in reality, the way a person interacts with a software product just like how they do with other humans.\nAs designers, it is necessary to ponder and understand how people are going to feel when they use your product. The capacity to handle the relationships and being aware of the emotions is known as emotional intelligence. This important skill is often what is missing in most of the software designs these days.\nFacebook, for example, only had a like button for many years. Their users had only this option apart from the comments box to express themselves no matter whether they liked or disliked a post. But Facebook came to understand the importance of changing this icon and introduced ‘reactions’ or ’emojis’ such as “sad,” “wow,” “haha,” “love” and “angry.” It was a great way for them to boost user interaction and engagement.\nYou can define the emotional Intelligence primarily with these five characteristics:\nSelf-Awareness\nSelf-Regulation\nMotivation\nEmpathy\nPeople Skills\nSelf Regulation and Self Awareness\nSince software does not have any feelings, ultimately what it expresses is explicitly coming from the designer who does have opinions. One of the best examples we have of self-awareness is how Facebook inquires with their users to check if they are okay to see ads which are based on their behavior.\nBesides creating an excellent experience for the user, it is also relevant to the user.\nSelf-regulation is being able to use the numbers wisely. You should not think that since the analytics are going up, it is a good thing. For example, one professional website used to spam users contacts by sending messages on behalf of the user to their connections to increase the engagement rate. This happened even when the user did not want to interact with some people on their contact list. While it did help the engagement rate to rise, the trust in the company fell drastically when the user identified this practice, and the engagement rate was obviously not authentic. It is one reason why most of the social media platforms nowadays have a disclaimer below the login credentials that they will not post content on behalf of the user.\nMotivation\nDesigners need to understand their user’s motivations to inform their own. One of the best ways to understand motivation is to change the perspective. Of course, this is the hardest thing to do and can be very challenging. Nevertheless, considering perspective can lead to improvements in design.\nFor example, how would a person who is overweight feel when he cannot find the clothes of his size available at a store? He feels rejected and also thinks that the store is only meant for a body of a particular type. In the same way, since people of different backgrounds and experience use your product, they should not feel left out.\nOne potential way to assist a designer in building a website that considers different perspectives is having people of different backgrounds and life circumstances as part of their development team. They will be able to give better feedback on how they feel about using a particular product. Since more perspectives are at the table, you will have fewer blind spots, and as a designer, you can create more things that people want.\nEmpathy and People’s Skill\nHaving a little humility can be of great help. Since designers are usually not end-users of a product, they need to understand how people want to use the product they are going to design. You cannot find out this information unless you do some research.\nIt is a bit like when your uncle gives you an iTunes gift card because your brother likes them and he thinks that you might like it as well. But you might not be someone who loves music, and the gift is not a good fit for you. Every time as a designer you create a product, you need to consider if it is something the end-users love using.\nIt’s not just about excellent but appropriate content. The number of airplane crashes reduced significantly because designers were able to use the crash data to create more robust and strong planes. In the same manner, designers need to take the time to test assumptions, to be wrong and change their thinking. Proper research will help you come with many questions as well as answers.\nIn Conclusion\nWhen the product acts mindlessly, it fails to incorporate people’s emotions, affecting someone’s feeling, health, support systems, and livelihood. Smart use of emotional intelligence can prevent designers from falling into the same shortcomings of yesterday’s design. Addressing users as whole human beings with a range of emotional experiences means making emotional intelligence a cornerstone of web design. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

You become known for being the person who has meetings on the way to their meetings. This feeling is the epitome of being the lone Product Owner who desperately needs their CEO to realize that it’s time to scale. Product Owners who experience this don’t work efficiently, as they are extremely burned out, making scaling up the product department unavoidable. It’s best to realize that your team needs to scale before there is a complete breakdown. Read on to get tips for recognizing when it’s time to scale.\nProduct Owners often fall into one of two situations. The first happens when there is only one Product Owner (PO)for the whole company. This PO wears many hats, which is often the case in startup environments. Because an employee in this role is expected to have a broad skill set, it is common for them to oversee both technical and managerial duties. These POs may do anything from market research to code reviews managing engineers. When this is the case, the lone PO can become burned out when their workload needs to ramp up. While many CEOs feel that hiring another PO is costly, it can, in fact, be more cost-effective than overloading a single PO. Hiring another PO presents the opportunity for them to specialize in a particular area of expertise.\nThe second situation arises when the company has decided to expand its product offering. Whether it’s the first time or the fifth, it’s a massive undertaking for almost everyone involved. From validating the market to writing brand new lines of code overseeing feature development, the current Product Owner(s) have their work cut out for them. Owners may find themselves excited about new products and let the old trusty product(s) fall to the wayside. Luckily, it is the PO’s job not to let this happen and to maintain the existing products. Sustaining quality products is extremely hard to do when new expectations arise, requiring management of new products as well. Now is the time to scale.\nAll this talk of PO’s may have you wondering who Zibtek’s PO is. His name is Jared Cambra, and we really like him! Read his post on How to be a Great Agile Product Owner.\nWhen to Hire Another Product Owner – From the PM’s Standpoint:\nWhile their own capabilities more or less determine each PO’s bandwidth, the intricacies of each product also play into determining each team member’s capacity. Don’t think of a new team member as a threat. Instead, understand that adding more human power will either give you the possibility of a promotion (got management skills?) or get you back to attainable work goals (takes a deep breath).\nHow to Know When It’s Time to Scale Up:\nYou can’t give enough time and effort to what each task requires\nYou’re unable to maintain Agile methods\nYou’ve already overextended yourself\nIf your company is adding a new product, your time is split 50/50 or more on the new product.\nWhen to Hire Another Product Owner – From the Company’s Standpoint:\nIf your team is only one PO. they’ve got an expansive to-do list; MDR’s, wireframes, plans for testing, and training the sales team, etc. Scaling your product management team may be more efficient as it gets each team member back to working in their wheelhouse. Bringing more skillsets into the company can also bring clarity, more coverage, and better ideas. What would have been overlooked by one PO may be seen as an opportunity to integrate products to another.\nHow to Know When It’s Time to Scale Up:\nThere is a greater time span between deliverables from your PO team\nWork product is becoming sloppy or buggy\nThe code is going untested and pushed straight into production\nYour PM hasn’t smiled in weeks…\nHow to Break Up the Workload\nWhen you and your team think about developing, think about daily and weekly goals. A huge project can seem ambiguous if it’s not thought about and talked about as smaller pieces. While this may seem obvious, if you’re team knows how their weekly goals relate to the overall project, it will seem less ambiguous.\nWhile having a plan is no doubt, a good plan, the plan cannot be entirely rigid. That just wouldn’t be Agile! The most efficient of teams can react to new information without having to scrap hours or days worth of work. Software engineers are wired this way.\nIf you are adding a new product, there may need to be a specific PO for each product. If you’ve got one product that is going through a major overhaul, requiring your team to scale, breaking the workload up by feature may be the best option.\nPOs can have vastly different skill sets. While some sales-minded PO’s will find comfort in supporting the sales team with training courses and collateral, developer-minded PO’s will spend much of their time overseeing features being built and doing code reviews and talking architecture with engineers. Ideally, POs for a new product should be separated into Product Managers and Product Marketers. Product Managers will work closely with the development team to meet requirements while Product Marketers will develop a go-to-market strategy by working with the sales team. By utilizing the skill sets of both of these people, product planning can be strategic for more than one department. As always, have a plan for accountability for every team member.

It is because they miss one of the key ingredients in the growth mindset. Though they want to grow, they have a very vague idea of how to get there.\nLacking a general understanding of business principles is one of the key reasons why you might fail. You need to follow a few principles strictly if you want to see an increase in the growth rate or want to optimize the process. Here is a list of principles that are proven to help businesses succeed:\nPrinciple # 1 Learn From Experience\nTesting your ideas should be the basis to see growth. In a nutshell, testing your idea, or hypothesis is nothing but running a battery of tests to see which one works well and which one does not work well for you. We make a hypothesis because we firmly believe that we can find a better solution to a problem.\nBy carrying out the tests, you can either validate or invalidate the hypothesis. Though most people check this aspect using a success or failure lens, you should understand the fact that there is no such thing as failure when it comes to growth.\nSuccess happens when you learn and failure when you do not. Even though you might have failed, you will still gain a lot of insights, which can be viewed as a success. Only after learning a subject well, you can make an educated guess. This knowledge will help you to launch successful experiments later.\nNever expect to get a lot of success at the initial stage. You will eventually get there when you start to understand both the product and customer well.\nPrinciple # 2 Be Data-Driven\nBy running a digital business, you will find ways to measure every step of your way. You can track easily what’s happening on your app. The three types of information that drive the growth insight are quantitative, qualitative, and intuitive.\nWhen the topic of data pops up, everyone immediately thinks about tools such as Google Analytics and KiSSmetrics. But you should never forget about the other valuable sources of insights that are available.\nCustomer interviews are the perfect source of insights as they can help drive growth or product development. By investing in the analytics stack early on, you will avoid pursuing developments that won’t help your product and can focus on those that do.\nPrinciple # 3 Employ Innovative Testing\nInnovative thinking and creative ideas are the foundation for steady and consistent growth. You should never limit yourself by doing things just like your competitors. Don’t limit yourself to what has already been proven effective but see if you can find other ways of reaching the end result that is more effective.\nTo be innovative, you need to question and go against the status-quo. For example, if your competitors are using a 3 step signup process, it does not mean that you should assume this is the only way that makes sense.\nThink of ways to enhance the process by finding the flaws. You will limit your potential results when you stop being innovative. Remember that growth is all about being creative and innovative.\nPrinciple # 4 Never Give Up\nIt is terrific if you are having a conversion rate of 90% and above from trial period to paid subscription. But you should also recognize the fact that there are things that you can always improve. If you think that everything is optimized, it is wise to take a one week break. Go back with a fresh mind to see things differently and start assessing the application with new eyes. I am a firm believer that most people are not willing to be bad at something long enough to find success.\nAsk yourself questions such as: Where are we losing most of the users and where can I make an impact? Never be happy with the growth that you are getting but put in time and effort to go further.\nPrinciple # 5 Put Proper Process in Place\nLaunching experiments are just one part of the story that you can see. It is the process that makes everything possible. There is no way you can sustain your growth when you do not have a process in place.\nThough you might be launching new experiments, there’s a chance that you will soon lose track of what is happening. It is the process that will allow you to create a repeatable, scalable and predictable machine.\nPrinciple # 6 Aim for Authentic and Sustainable Growth\nIt is essential for you to know that not all growth is equal. One of the questions that you need to ask yourselves is: Are you looking for Monthly Active Users (MAU) or customers that are long-term?\nYou need to understand that meaningful growth adds value to both the user and the company. Growth that is sustainable over a period of the time is called sustainable growth. You need to find a growth pattern that you can repeat to enjoy sustainable growth.\nPrinciple # 7 Be Customer-Centric\nYou will not drive any short-term growth when you are not customer-centric. If your customers get annoyed, it is tough to retain them. Never forget that increasing the growth is just one part of the equation.\nIf you are trying to squeeze dollars from the customer’s wallet without adding any value, you will soon annoy people. It is essential for you to evaluate if the experiments that you are making will help them achieve their mission or the goals.\nThere are many ways to grow businesses, and there are many potential businesses that you could grow. Underlying these diverse ventures are core principles. By following these principles for growth, you can avoid common mistakes and move toward success. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

    "extractedText": "5 Technology Trends in Software Development to Improve Your Processes\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n28 JAN 2020 • 5 MIN READ\nThese days, competition among businesses is fierce. If your company doesn’t deliver high-quality products and services promptly, customers can simply go somewhere else. In order to help your enterprise business stay competitive in the market, it’s important to reduce the time between the development and product release phases. The best way to do this is by strengthening your software development teams and employing reliable technologies to ensure the best quality products and services.\nTechnology is constantly changing and iterating. Staying current with your tech means you’re staying current with the market. With these five software development trends, you will be able to:\nSpeed up your development, testing, and deployment processes.\nKeep a closer line of communication from customers to developers to operations.\nBe confident in your business’s ability to meet customer requirements.\nBetter analyze your business requirements.\nMake better decisions for your business.\n1. DevOps with continuous delivery\nDevOps—a combination of the words “development” and “operations”—is a methodology based on the constant collaboration between development and operations teams in a company. Historically, the development team dealt with writing software while the operations team focused on testing and deploying code to production. The process of testing and deploying code usually took a lot of time, resulting in fewer code releases. With DevOps, the development and operation teams collaborate closely and deploy code daily through the use of automation.\nDevOps is an advancement of an Agile methodology. This is where software projects are divided into several modules then a continuous iteration of tasks—including requirement gathering, planning, designing, development, and testing—are done concurrently across all of the software modules. Once finished, all the features integrate for final testing. While Agile methodologies bridge the gap between customers and developers by helping to clearly define key requirements and work that must be completed, virtually all testing and development are left until the end of the process.\nWith DevOps methodologies added on to Agile, that final gap (the one between developers and operations) is bridged. Code that is written by the development team is constantly tested and deployed by the operations team daily instead of all at once when the code is complete. This process, known as continuous delivery, helps ensure that bugs are caught early and software is always “production-ready” at any time. It allows for customer feedback to be cycled in more frequently.\n2. Acceptance test-driven development (ATDD)\nAcceptance test-driven development (ATDD) involves collaborative discussion between customers, developers, and testers. The main focus is on customer needs which leads to better code and testing.\nA regular workflow in ATDD might look like:\nA team accepts a user story.\nThat team collaborates with product owners to get additional criteria and information needed to flesh out the details on what is required of the product for the user story to be complete. This is generally called acceptance test criteria.\nThe team writes a series of test cases to evaluate whether the acceptance test criteria has passed.\nBefore beginning development, the tests are executed on the current product. These tests will (intentionally) fail.\nDevelopers begin work writing the code that will make the test cases pass.\nThe development is complete once all tests for the acceptance test criteria pass.\nAcceptance test-driven development is closely related to, yet different from, test-driven development (TDD). While both ATDD and TDD focus on early execution of test cases before coding, ATDD differs in that it is less focused on automated code testing and more on fulfilling business requirements. ATDD is beneficial to businesses because it encourages teams to view success as fulfilling customer’s requirements more than just getting an automated test to pass.\nSince the code is constantly tested for requirement acceptance, bugs and issues are resolved faster which helps prevent bigger problems down the road. Plus, with ATDD there is better collaboration among business analysts, developers, product owners, and testers throughout the entire development process.\n3. Container-based applications\nSoftware applications typically have a hefty combination of configurations, dependencies, and code that are all unique to that particular project. This can get messy for large teams of developers working on many projects. Trying to host multiple repositories of code and configurations often leads to the “well, it works on my computer!” problem.\nContainer-based applications fix all of that by providing a unified way to logically pack each app’s configurations, code, and dependencies all into a single object. When a developer wants to work on that project, they run the container with everything the app needs to run. Then, when they are done, they switch containers.\nThis process significantly speeds up development. When engineers don’t have to worry about configuring and debugging their environments, they can focus on the actual coding at hand.\nContainerization also makes deployment easy since it hides implementation details and only shows relevant data to whatever platform it is running on (public cloud, private data center, personal laptop, etc). This means that operation teams can focus specifically on deployment details and not on irrelevant application details.\n4. Predictive analytics with big data\nBack in 2017, the number of devices connected to the internet was already at over 7 billion. That number has only grown, particularly with the rise of the internet of things (IoT). Every new device that is connected to the internet provides large amounts of data, ripe for analysis.\nSuccessful enterprises have learned to leverage this data using predictive analytics to draw insight into growth possibilities and potential risks for their business. Predictive analytics uses a combination of statistical algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI) to forecast the future. It can help your business by:\nImproving decision-making: Decisions based on data are always better than decisions not based on data, at least in business. Predictive analytics uses big data—complex and voluminous data—to identify the best practices for your business.\nPromoting better customer relationships: Big data and predictive analytics can be used to predict customer requirements before they even know what they want. These processes can also be used to analyze and predict market behavior.\nIncreasing profitability: Predictive analytics can be leveraged to improve marketing promotions, winning you more customers and sales.\nHere are the top five predictive analytics software that you can use for your business:\nSisense\nOracle Crystal Ball\nMicrosoft R Open\nMicrosoft Azure Machine Learning Studio\nIBM SPSS Predictive Analytics Enterprise\n5. Service virtualization\nTesting before development was finished used to be impossible since the test environment lacked vital dependencies—such as key parts of the unfinished code. Service virtualization, the practice of mocking up specific components to imitate expected behavior, makes testing unfinished code possible.\nUsing service virtualization, DevOps teams can implement virtual services in place of production services. This enables frequent and comprehensive testing, even when key components are missing from the system architecture, Since sections of the product can be tested as they come out, the speed of development and delivery can be significantly improved.\nThis is especially useful for large and complex applications. If all testing is left until the end, there’s a big chance that there will be deeply rooted bugs that will take ages to fix. When sections of large projects are tested as they come out, issues are caught and iterated on early in the process, creating a smoother development process. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

    "extractedText": "ECOMMERCE\n5 Signs You're Ready for Custom Web Development\nVedant Vyas\nRead more posts by this author.\nVEDANT VYAS\n25 MAY 2025 • 6 MIN READ\nIn 2025, global eCommerce sales are set to hit $7.4 trillion, yet 63% of shoppers abandon sites that take over four seconds to load. Many businesses hit a growth ceiling because off-the-shelf platforms simply can’t keep up. Custom web development breaks through those limits—delivering speed, flexibility, security, and integration abilities tailored to your unique needs. In this post, we’ll explore five clear signs you’re ready to upgrade to a custom eCommerce solution, guiding you from diagnosis to action—and showing how Zibtek’s expertise and its OnCourse CRM can power your next phase of growth.\nOff-the-shelf stores can get you online quickly, but they often come with hidden costs: slow performance, rigid features, and patchwork integrations that hamper growth. In fact, a slow site can cost you up to 7% of your conversions for every extra second of load time—and half of shoppers won’t return after a poor experience. Custom web development offers a tailored path forward: speed-optimized code, bespoke features, enterprise-grade security, and seamless ERP/CRM connectivity. With Zibtek’s full-service ecommerce web development, you not only break free from platform limitations but also set the stage for scalable expansion and higher ROI. Ready to see if you qualify? Check the Custom-Readiness Checklist now to benchmark your store’s readiness.\nSign 1: Performance Drag\nSpeed kills. A one-second delay in page response can slash your conversions by up to 7%. Worse still, if pages take over four seconds to load, 63% of customers abandon ship. Slow load times also harm SEO, pushing your site down the rankings just when you need visibility most.\nOff-the-shelf themes and generic hosting stacks aren’t built for peak performance. They load unnecessary code, rely on shared resources, and fail to optimize images or JavaScript for your catalog.\nHow Custom web development fixes it:\nOptimized Codebase: We strip out bloat, minify assets, and implement server-side caching tailored to your traffic patterns.\nProgressive Delivery: Lazy-loading images and asynchronous scripts ensure critical content appears first.\nDedicated Infrastructure: Scalable cloud environments auto-adjust to traffic spikes, preventing downtime.\nUse Zibtek’s free performance audit to get a real-time Lighthouse score and personalized recommendations.\nSign 2: Feature Limits\nOut-of-the-box eCommerce platforms come with preset features—but they can’t anticipate every unique business need. Struggling with limited filtering, no headless commerce support, or restricted checkout flows? These gaps frustrate both customers and your dev team.\nAccording to a report by CBI Insights, the Lean Startup methodology has been shown to reduce product development cycles by up to 50%\nHow custom ecommerce software development helps:\nBespoke Features: Build exactly what you need—whether it’s AI-driven recommendations, personalized search, or custom checkout steps.\nModular Architecture: Add or upgrade features without rewriting the core code.\nFuture-Proofing: Scale functionality as your business evolves, avoiding the costs of repeated theme swaps.\nLet Zibtek’s ecommerce web designers map your current vs. ideal feature set and deliver a two-page blueprint.\nSign 3: Security Risks\nCyber-attacks cost retailers $2.9 billion annually in fraud and downtime. Standard platforms may plug known vulnerabilities, but zero-day exploits and compliance updates can leave you exposed. If you handle credit cards, you’re bound by PCI DSS; if you serve EU customers, GDPR is non-negotiable.\nZibtek’s approach: implement robust encryption, regular penetration testing, and automated compliance checks. We integrate Web Application Firewalls (WAFs), Content Security Policies (CSPs), and two-factor admin authentication to lock down your store.\nWhy it matters:\nAvoid Fines & Penalties: Non-compliance with PCI DSS can mean hefty fines, plus loss of customer trust.\nProtect Customer Data: A breach can cost $150 per record, not to mention reputational damage.\nSign 4: Scaling Issues\nBlack Friday traffic spikes should be an opportunity, not a crisis. Yet many hosted platforms throttle bandwidth or charge exorbitant overage fees when you exceed plan limits. The result? Downtime, revenue loss, and customer frustration precisely when demand peaks.\nZibtek’s custom web development employs auto-scaling cloud resources (AWS, Azure, or GCP) with predictive provisioning, so you pay only for what you use—and never go offline under pressure.\nReal-world impact:\nCost Control: Predict and cap your infrastructure spend.\nUptime Guarantees: 99.9% SLA keeps your store live during peak events.\nSign 5: Lack of Integration\nManual order fulfillment, siloed inventory data, and disjointed customer profiles waste hours—and money. Without real-time sync between your store, ERP, and CRM, you risk overselling, mismanaging stock, and losing customers to errors.\nWith custom web development, Zibtek crafts RESTful APIs or middleware connectors that link your eCommerce platform to OnCourse (our proprietary CRM), NetSuite, SAP, or any legacy system. This seamless data flow accelerates order processing, personalizes marketing, and eliminates data entry headaches.\nBenefits:\nOperational Efficiency: Reduce processing time by up to 40%.\nBetter Customer Insights: Unified profiles for targeted promotions and support.\nSchedule a free consultation with our developer ecommerce specialists to design your integration roadmap.\nZibtek’s Custom eCommerce Services\nZibtek is a full-spectrum custom software development firm specializing in ecommerce web development, offering end-to-end solutions from strategy and design through build, QA, and support.

Zibtek’s custom web development and ecommerce web development services deliver a tailored foundation built to scale, secure, and differentiate your brand. Plus, with OnCourse CRM integrated from day one, you’ll capture more leads, close more sales, and delight customers with every touchpoint.\nSchedule a Free Strategy SessionLet our ecommerce web designers and developer ecommerce experts craft a roadmap that turns your challenges into growth opportunities.\nHow much does custom eCommerce development cost? Costs vary by scope. According to Shopify, a custom build ranges from $2,000 to $20,000+ based on complexity, integrations, and support level. How long does a custom eCommerce project take? Timelines depend on features and integrations. Simple customizations can launch in 6–8 weeks, while full-scale custom ecommerce software development often spans 3–6 months. Can I integrate my existing ERP/CRM with a custom eCommerce site? Absolutely. Custom web development enables API-based connectors or middleware to unify data between your store, OnCourse CRM, ERP, and other systems. Why choose custom web development over off-the-shelf solutions? Custom solutions eliminate feature bottlenecks, boost performance, ensure robust security, and scale cost-effectively—delivering a unique, future-proof platform designed for your business.

    "extractedText": "Everything you need to know about a user interface programmer\nVedant Vyas\nRead more posts by this author.\nVEDANT VYAS\n25 JAN 2021 • 6 MIN READ\nHow do humans interact with machines? This is a question that some of the world’s best and brightest minds have grappled with for decades. It’s what ultimately gave us what we now refer to as the UI or user interface.\nSimply put, a user interface is what enables the interaction between a machine and a human. The primary goal of the UI is to allow humans to effectively control the machine while the machine returns information that helps the human make further decisions.\nIt's essential to have a good user interface. That's the crux of user interface design. It needs to be easy and efficient while also being enjoyable for the user. The idea must always be that minimal input should be enough for the desired output.\nThat’s easier said than done. User interface programming is an entire field in its own right. It’s a skill that can be improved upon with time and experience. It requires the user interface programmers to have a firm grasp of good design and psychology to create an intuitive UI.\nWhat is a user interface programmer?\nA user interface programmer is tasked with using front end technology to bring creative software design concepts to life. They must be able to form an understanding of the user interface design solution from both its practical and creative vision.\nThe UI programmer then acts as a bridge between the backend and the presentation layer. It's their job to create a translational layer between the two, which is known as the UI, so that both aspects can deliver up to their full potential.\nIt's the UI programmer's job to figure out a way around technology constraints to prioritize users and business requirements. They must design and create software interfaces that hold true to those principles.\nWhat does a UI programmer do?\nA UI programmer first participates in the design process to provide consultation concerning the possibilities of a user interface for an app’s development. The design that's eventually created by the UX designer is then taken as input by the UI programmer who then engineers it into reality.\nIt does require a lot of knowledge and skill. The programmer needs to have an in-depth understanding of the user interface development tech stack. They must be familiar with frameworks like CSS, JavaScript, HTML, Angular, etc.\nOne of the biggest responsibilities of a UI programmer is to ensure that the designs they create can automatically conform to different screen sizes and devices. This is what's known as responsive design.\nThe programmer has to operate under the assumption that the app will be used by people that have one of the many different mobile and desktop devices and platforms that are now available. Therefore, they have to make sure that the work is done keeping responsive design in mind.\nIt’s also important for them to stay on top of user interface design trends. They tend to shift quite rapidly in this day and age. New trends can come in quickly and the programmers have to adapt so that their designers always look modern and never outdated.\nWhat skills do they need?\nUser interface programmers need to have a broad range of skills. This includes familiarity with modern application programming languages like XHTML, Ruby, PHP, .NET, and more. They must also have knowledge of front-end development languages like HTML and CSS.\nThe Adobe Creative Suite programs are great resources to utilize for UI design and as such, they need to be proficient in tools like Adobe Illustrator and Flash. This will enable them to effectively bring the design concept to life.\nUsability is another key skill that user interface programmers need to have. Usability testing is done to identify any issues that exist in the user interface which may have been missed. Actual feedback can also be collected from users and all of that can then be utilized to fix and improve the UI in the future.\nWhat are the three types of user interfaces?\nCommand Line Interface\nA lot of people who used computers before GUIs were a thing will remember the Command Line Interface or CLI all too fondly. A CLI is a text-based user interface that allows you to interact with a computer on a low abstraction level. It's a bit complex, and as such, it's not meant for the average user.\nCLIs are still used by system administrators or when working with cloud services. There are a lot of programs and services that offer both a CLI and a GUI in order to make it easy to automate processes. The terminals of both major operating systems, Windows and Mac, are perhaps the best examples of a Command Line Interface.\nThere are several benefits of CLIs. They don't have a lot of CPU processing requirements and they're much faster than other types of user interfaces. It's easy to scale them in size and they're able to work on a lower resolution screen as well. Advanced users can get maximum value from a CLI by automating repetitive tasks into one command.\nA Menu-based interface\nAs the name suggests, a Menu-based interface takes the user through a series of screens or menus until the desired outcome is achieved. Users are required to make a selection from a list format or graphics. They are taken to the next menu after making a selection.\nThe settings menu on mobile devices is the perfect example of a Menu-based user interface. Users can only scroll the available options and tap on the ones provided. They can't interact with it in any other way.\nA Menu-based interface is a great option if the product is aimed at novice users or just to exercise more control over user interactions. There are some limitations, though. Menu options are restricted while sub-menus can be difficult to locate. This may not be a good fit for most kinds of apps.\nGraphical User Interface\nThis is perhaps the most popular type of user interface. The Graphical User Interface or GUI can be as simple or complex as the programmer intends it to be. This flexibility is what allows for a variety of exceptional experiences to be created.\nDespite the ability to create complex experiences, the beauty of a GUI is that even novice users can find their way around it rather easily. Furthermore, attractive visuals can be added to improve the look of the GUI.\nUI programmers need to be mindful of the fact that the more complex a GUI, the more power and memory resources it's going to require. So an app meant for low-end devices should probably have as simple a GUI as possible so that it's capable of properly running on devices that don't have a lot of processing power.\nFinding a user interface programmer for your custom app\nThat’s a question that many businesses find themselves struggling with when they decide to get a custom app made. It’s not just about finding a user interface programmer. They’re a dime a dozen these days. Only a quick online search will return countless programmers all claiming that they can do the very best job for you.\nWhat’s more important is finding the right user interface programmer for your custom app. You want to work with someone who is skilled, knows what they’re doing, have a portfolio of work that you can review, and are capable of bringing your vision to reality.\nFinding a user interface programmer that ticks all of those boxes will require you to conduct some research. You’ll need to sort through the crowd and find the one that’s truly going to become the right partner for your project. Once you do find the programmer that’s just the right fit for your project, everything else will seem to fall into place.\nConsult with Zibtek\nIf your search for a user interface programmer has led you here, you’ve come to the right place.

    "extractedText": "Outsourcing Software Development? Avoid These 5 Common Mistakes\nVedant Vyas\nRead more posts by this author.\nVEDANT VYAS\n2 JUN 2021 • 4 MIN READ\nOutsourcing software development isn’t a new practice, but it’s becoming much more desirable. As technologies advance rapidly, hiring and maintaining an in-house team of developers is expensive in more ways than one. Employee costs and the hardware and software needed to get the job done can make custom software out of reach for many businesses.\nWhen you outsource software development, you get on-demand scalability and access to a wealth of unique and niche skill sets that might otherwise be unattainable. While the benefits of outsourcing are undeniable, there are a few things to watch out for when choosing an outsourcing company.\nIt’s often said collaborating with the “right” outsourcing partner ensures a successful product launch. Today, let’s talk about some of the most common ways companies get it “wrong” when conducting their selection process.\nMistakes to Avoid When Outsourcing Software Development\nIt seems so simple—you pay a third-party company to develop your app or software. But then you start the process and quickly realize it’s anything but. Creating custom software is much more than writing code and launching a product. It’s well worth taking your time to find a qualified outsource software development company that can help you achieve your goals. This brings us to our first mistake.\nMistake #1: Not Knowing What Your Goals Are\nYou might know what you want your software or app to do, but do you know how you want to get there? Clear, realistic expectations and a well-defined project scope help your outsource team complete the project on time and deliver the product you envision. It also makes for a super smooth relationship. Here are just some of the things to consider when planning your project:\nAre you starting from scratch or building on an existing solution?\nDoes the software need to integrate with existing solutions?\nIs the app for internal use only, or is it customer-faced? Do you intend to sell it?\nWill the app use smartphone hardware?\nDo you already have some source code you want to use?\nWhat, if any, are your industry-specific regulations?\nWill you need your outsourcing partner to also perform ongoing maintenance?\nClearly define what you want to accomplish within the outsourced relationship, and you stand an excellent chance of a successful launch.\nMistake #2: Failing to Budget\nCost is a crucial consideration in outsourcing, but it shouldn’t get in the way of quality. Outsourcing tends to reduce the cost of software development, but that doesn’t mean it comes cheap. Knowing your budget ahead of time helps you and the software developer quickly determine if a partnership is feasible. A healthy dose of pragmatism helps here, too. If you talk with multiple providers you like, but they all seem to be quoting above your budget, you might need to reassess if your cost expectations are realistic. One of the worst decisions you can make is to go with the cheapest company that promises to deliver everything when other companies have told you it’s not possible.\nMistake #3: Not Asking About Methodology\nNo matter how awesome your app or software idea, if the methodology your software development partner uses results in a slow time to market, you’re not getting the ROI you deserve. Zibtek uses a “practical Agile” approach to software development that focuses strongly on a project’s entire lifecycle. Agile methodologies setting up phases of development make collaboration clear, concise, and effective. The result is predictable delivery dates, better project control, and a higher-quality product.\nMistake #4: Not Establishing Communication Ground Rules\nRegular two-way communication is tantamount to success. Transparency throughout the development process is crucial as it minimizes misunderstandings and assumptions, ensuring the entire team, including the product owner, is on the same page.\nGood communication starts from day one. Asking the big questions up front helps you know what to expect. Important asks might include: What is the technical focus of your company? What is your process? What is your security policy—how do you handle disaster recovery and data security? How do you ensure our data is properly secured?\nMistake #5: Not Researching Your Choices\nAny outsource development company worth their salt will share case studies with you. Does the company work with businesses and industries similar to yours? Do the work examples clearly explain the owner’s goal and the solution? Remember, coding isn’t everything—though you won’t get your product without it! Many software developers lack the business competencies to convert your vision into function.\nFor Outsourcing Software Development, Work with a Reliable Company\nOutsourcing software development is an excellent way for your organization to achieve its digital goals. You get access to a larger talent pool, can scale up or down on command, and mitigate security risks. Zibtek helps companies develop custom software from start to finish. Our world-class teams deliver cost-effective and reliable solutions on time and on budget. To learn more about how we do it, get in touch with us today. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

    "extractedText": "NODE.JS\nTypes of Applications You Can Build With Node.js\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n12 OCT 2019 • 8 MIN READ\nWhat is Node.js?\nOn the modern web, it’s hard to ignore the ubiquity of Node.js. Node.js is a free and open-source platform, runs on javascript that allows you to develop web applications quickly.To understand why you should use Node.js and which types of applications you can build with Node.js, here’s some information garnered from hundreds of projects developed by Zibtek a nodejs development company to help get you started.\nWhy Node.js?\nIt uses non-blocking I/O and event-driven architecture that makes it efficient and light-weight.\nIt is built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine-- an open source engine that accepts JavaScript code and quickly compiles it into machine code.\nIt uses npm package manager (a largest ecosystem of open-source library). It contains all the files you need for the module.\nClick here https://www.npmjs.com/ to download thousands of free packages for your application.\nTypes of Applications You Can Build With Node.js\n1. Internet of Things (IoT)\nIoT is a concept of connecting physical devices among each other with the help of the internet. These devices are embedded with sensors, actuators, and beacons that enable them to send and exchange data. From business and home security, education and automobiles, healthcare and industrial equipment, agriculture and transport, to travel, insurance and entertainment, the IoT have spread rapidly across business sectors. With the popularity of IoT, Node.js has become one of the most prominent solutions for businesses to develop their public and private IoT devices.\nWhy Node.js for IoT systems?\n1. Node streams\nThere are millions of devices on IoT network that are generating and processing a huge amount of data. Node.js is capable of handling the IoT network through streams. Just like strings or arrays, streams are a collection of data. It is used to read data from the source and write data to a destination. Unlike strings or arrays, the Node.js stream doesn’t require to fit in the memory and this makes it a robust and powerful when working with voluminous data of IoT systems.\nThere are 4 types of stream in Node.js-\nWritable- It is used for the write operation.\nReadable- It is used for reading operation.\nDuplex- It can be used for both write and read operation.\nTransform- A type of Duplex stream that can transform or modify the data as it is read or written.\nWith Node streams, it’s easy to process multiple concurrent requests from various devices.\n2. Based on Event-driven architecture\nWith the event-driven architecture of Node.js, it can easily manage a plethora of sudden requests and data arrivals from IoT devices. Node.js uses a module called EventEmitter that enables you to incorporate event-driven programming in your project. EventEmitter releases the number of events so that the main loop can trigger a callback function as soon as a loop detects any new event.\nLook at the code snippet given below:\nconst EventEmitter = require('events').EventEmitter;\nconst myEventEmitter = new EventEmitter;\nIt’s easy to get started with event-driven driven programming in Node.Js. All you have to do is to use the EventEmitter class. This class can be accessed through the ‘events’ module. Event-driven programming approach in Node.js will eradicate any server-down or server-error issues in IoT network.\n3. Follows Asynchronous programming model\nIn traditional synchronous programming, your program gets stuck as other processes in the queue will be blocked until the execution of the previous process. To address this issue, Node.js has introduced asynchronous programming model. It enables other processes to continue before the execution of the previous process. This method enables the Node.js to handle heavy input/output operations in less time on the IoT network.\n4. NPM package manager\nNPM is a package manager of Node.js that is embedded with various powerful IoT modules. You can use these modules to create robust and scalable IoT applications.\n2. Real-time chats\nReal-time chat is a communication channel that offers live transmission of messages (including text, videos, files, etc.) from sender to receiver via the internet. Real-time chat includes one-to-one chat and one-to-many group chats and builds on varieties of tools like: instant messenger (IM), internet relay chat (IRC), etc. For example- WhatsApp, Google Talk, Skype, and Facebook Messenger.\nWhy Node.js for real-time chats?\nNode.js offers all basic services and components required for building real-time chats. Read the following to know why Node.js is the most preferred solution for real-time chat applications:\nPowerful Node APIs\nNode.js APIs depends on event-driven architecture in which EventEmitters periodically emits events to call listener objects. All the functions associated with the events are called synchronously and all values returned by the call listeners will be discarded and neglected. But, APIs of Node.js enables you to switch on the asynchronous mode by using process.nextTick() or setImmediate() methods in your code.\nLet’s look at the code snippet given below:\nconst EventEmitter = require('events');\nclass MyEmitter extends EventEmitter {}\nconst myEmitter = new MyEmitter();\nmyEmitter.on('event', function(a, b) {\nsetImmediate(() => {\nconsole.log('this happens asynchronously');\n});\nfunction cb(){\nconsole.log('processed in next iteration',a,b);\n}\nprocess.nextTick(cb)\nconsole.log('processed in first iteration',a,b);\n});\nmyEmitter.emit('event', 'Zibtek', 'Club');\nWith this functionality of Node.js, it becomes easy to implement-\nserver-sent events - A server-sent event is when a web page gets updates (including news feeds, Twitter/Facebook updates, sports results) from a server automatically. It is widely used in real-time applications and instant messaging systems.\nPush notification technology- With Node.js, it’s easy to use push notification technology with real-time chat applications. Push notification technology is a brief message in the form of alerts or updates that are sent to the users on their mobile phones. This technology has evolved from a conventional message delivery system to an interactive and advanced medium.\nNode.js WebSockets\nNode.js also works well with WebSockets.WebSocket is a protocol that is used to build web-based data streaming applications and real-time communication applications. It enables the fast two-way exchange of messages between the client and the server and deploys real-time applications easily and efficiently.\nWhy WebSockets?\n1. Enables a seamless real-time communication\nClient’s subscription to server-sent events is free in WebSockets. It enables you to easily broadcast your messages to every connected client.\n2. Data stream processing\nWith WebSockets, it is easy to stream binary data between server and client. This, in turn, makes it suitable for stream processing tasks such as image or video processing apps.\nImplementing real-time chat app with Node.js WebSockets\nNode.js WebSocket API for the chat server is embedded in the socket.io npm package. Socket.io allows for bidirectional real-time event-based communication. It comprised of-\nA Node.js client (a JavaScript client library for browser)\nA Node.js server\nAttaching socket.io to simple HTTP server is an initial step to building a real-time chat app.\nLook at the code snippet given below:\nconst server = require('http').createServer()\nconst io = require('socket.io')(server)\nio.on('connection', function (client) {\nclient.on('register', handleRegister)\nclient.on('join', handleJoin)\nclient.on('leave', handleLeave)\nclient.on('message', handleMessage)\nclient.on('chatrooms', handleGetChatrooms)\nclient.on('availableUsers', handleGetAvailableUsers)\nclient.on('disconnect', function () {\nconsole.log('client disconnect...', client.id)\nhandleDisconnect()\n})\nclient.on('error', function (err) {\nconsole.log('received error from client:', client.id)\nconsole.log(err)\n})\n})\nserver.listen(3000, function (err) {\nif (err) throw err\nconsole.log('listening on port 3000')\n})\nio.on(‘connection’, cb) is used to listen incoming socket connections. You can attach multiple event listeners to the stream after the new client connects. The disconnect and error events are pre-defined and all other events are custom events that are used to implement chat API. After this, you need to connect the socket server to the client by using const io = require('socket.io-client') and implement API.\n3. Single Page Applications (SPAs)\nA single-page application is a web application that runs inside a web browser and serves an astounding user experience (UX). It doesn’t require to load the entire page from the server when users interact with the application. This, in turn, reduces the response time (length of the time taken by the system to respond to the users) of an application. SPA websites present the content in a way that it becomes easy for the users to interact with the website.\nWhy Node.js for SPAs?\nNode Express and Node.js to create SPA\nNode Express is a robust and flexible web application framework of Node.js that provides a set of features to develop mobile and web applications. To reduce the server load and ensures API sharing across various environments and applications, Node Express and Node.js framework allows you to use routing in order to create a SPA.\nUsing routing feature in Node Express\nNode Express uses HTTP methods-\nGET- It provides read-only access to the resource.\nPUT- It creates a new resource.\nPOST- It updates an existing resource.\nDELETE- It deletes a resource.\nCode snippet to show basic use of routing in Node Express to create the SPA:\nvar express = require('express');\nvar app = express();\napp.get('/', function(request, response){\n// response.send('<h1>Homepage</h1><div>This is homepage.</div>'); // you can also directly write HTML content\nresponse.sendFile(__dirname + '/indexPage.html');\n});\napp.get('/about', function(request, response){\nresponse.sendFile(__dirname + '/aboutUS.html');\n});\napp.get('/contact', function(request, response){\nresponse.sendFile(__dirname + '/contactUS.html');\n});\napp.listen(3000, function(){\nconsole.log('Server running at port 3000: http://127.0.0.1:3000');\n});\nGET method is used to include indexPage, aboutUS and ContactUS are HTML files.\nNode.js and the browser use the same language, JavaScript\nIt enables developers to use the same language, data structures, and modular approaches on both client and server side, optimizing the maintainability of your SPAs, often paired with angular or react.\n4. Microservices architecture\nMicroservices architecture is an approach to building an application as a set of modular components. Let’s have a look at what the microservices approach is:\nApplication is broken into smaller modules. These modules can exchange information with each other.\nEach module is continuously developed, tested, and maintained separately.\nIn the end, all these modules are integrated to form an application.\nIts purpose is to make applications easy to understand, test, and maintain. This approach helps large enterprises where development teams span over a large geographic area, such as across cities, countries, etc. In recent years, many big companies (including Facebook, Netflix, eBay, Amazon) have adopted microservices architecture to run their unique business processes.\nWhy Node.js for microservices architecture?\nUsing Docker\nFor microservices, Node.js is an excellent solution. It uses docker (a conterization tool) to encapsulate microservices in different containers. This, in turn, avoid any issues in between application development environment.\nBuilding Node.js containers with Docker\nTo build containers, Node.js uses docker-compose up command. This command is used to run services by bringing up the network. Look at the code snippet given below.\n# Run `docker-compose build` to build the images\n# Run `docker-compose up` to run the containers\n# Run `docker-compose down` to remove the containers\nversion: '3.5'\nservices:\nmysql:\ncontainer_name: service_mysql\nimage: mysql:5.7\nvolumes:\n- ~/datadir/mysql:/var/lib/mysql\nports:\n- 3306:3306\n- 33060:33060\nenvironment:\nMYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root\nnetworks:\n- service_network\nredis:\ncontainer_name: service_redis\nimage: redis:4.0\nvolumes:\n- ~/datadir/redis:/var/lib/redis\nports:\n- 6379:6379\nnetworks:\n- service_network\napi:\ncontainer_name: service_api\nbuild: ./apiapp/\nimage: service_api\nvolumes:\n- ./apiapp/:/usr/src/app\n- /usr/src/app/node_modules\nports:\n- 3000:3000\n- 9229:9229\ndepends_on:\n- mysql\n- redis\n- notification\nnetworks:\n- service_network\napp2:\nbuild: ./notification/\nimage: service_notification\ncontainer_name: service_notify\nenvironment:\n- NODE_ENV=local\nvolumes:\n- ./notification/:/usr/src/app\n- /usr/src/app/node_modules\nports:\n- 4000:4000 # Notification api port\n- 9223:9223 # Node debugg port\n- 8099:8099 # GRPC port\ndepends_on:\n- mysql\nnetworks:\n- service_network\nnetworks:\nservice_network:\ndriver: bridge\nname: service_network\nThere are 4 containers in this docker compose file. After this, you need to create API to connect these containers with a Mysql database.\nCreates easy-to-use API to connect Node containers with Mysql\nNode.js can create easy-to-use APIs for microservices. It helps modular the node containers to communicate better with each other.\nLook at the code snippet given below:\nconst mysql = require('mysql2/promise');\nconst config = {\nuser: 'root',\npassword: 'root',\ndatabase: 'testdb',\nhost: 'mysql',\nconnectTimeout: 80000,\n};\nmysql.createConnection(config)\n.then((connection) => {\nconsole.log(`connection established to local ${config.database} database`);\nglobal.MYconnection = connection;\n})\n.catch((e) => {\nconsole.log(e);\neventEmitter.emit('connectionFailed', 'Destination');\n});\nWant to build amazing applications?

    "extractedText": "NODE.JS\n7 Answers to the Most Frequently Asked Questions About NodeJS\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n18 JUL 2019 • 5 MIN READ\nQuestion no. 1: What is Node.js?\nAnswer: Node.js is a free and open-source platform that uses JavaScript on the server to build fast, lightweight and scalable web applications. It can run on various operating systems’ platforms, including Mac OS X, Unix, Linux, Windows, etc.\nQuestion no. 2: Why is Node.js popular?\nAnswer: Here are the top 5 reasons why Node.js is popular:\n1. It uses JavaScript\nNode.js uses JavaScript to build web-based applications. JavaScript is the most powerful programming language used to provide interactivity to web pages. The graph below shows responses to the ‘Developers surveys results-2024’. It shows that 69.8 % of developers prefer JavaScript language to create dynamic web pages.\nMost popular technologies among developers\nWith Node.js, JavaScript has revolutionized web technology. JavaScript follows an out-of-order execution approach. This means the program is executed such that the processor can run the instructions (code) independently and immediately without waiting for the previous instructions (code) to complete. Node.js uses this approach (out-of-order execution) of JavaScript to build scalable web applications, real-time chats, IoT applications and more. Tech-giants, including Google, Amazon and Facebook rely on Node.js for some of their services.\n2. It is fast\nNode.js is powered by V8 JavaScript engine, developed by Google for use in Chrome and server-side platforms (including MongoDB and Node.js). As compared to other JavaScript engines, V8 engine executes the JavaScript code very fast and quickly compiles it into machine code.\nNode.js follows the asynchronous approach, which means the entire code is executed at once. Two threads can run in parallel and are independent of each other. They don’t interrupt each other at the time of execution. This is another factor that makes Node.js faster and more efficient than other technologies such as PHP, Ruby, etc.\n3. It is lightweight\nNode.js is based on event-driven architecture. This means all input/output operations are executed on a single thread, in an asynchronous manner. Let’s understand this with the help of an example:\nSuppose 200 people are connected at once through a network. Instead of running different threads for different connections, Node.js will loop all these connections on a single thread (This is in contrast with other web technologies such as PHP where a new thread is spawned for every new connection). It will give instructions about the generated events (actions or occurrence). This means it will notify you with every occurrence, such as if a new client joined the connection, if any existing client left the connection, if any client sends any message, etc. Also, if any connection is idle, then it will skip over it, rather than consuming the CPU time on it, ensuring the CPU is utilized efficiently. Everything in Node.js is based on responding to these events. Therefore, there is no buffering in Node.js applications, it gives output in the form of chunks. This makes Node.js a lightweight platform.\n4. Easier to maintain and modify\nUnlike traditional web technologies, in Node.js a bunch of small applications is created instead of a large and single application. Therefore, it’s easy to make modifications or add new functionalities in the code.\n5. High performance\nHere are some examples of the performance capabilities of Node.js:\nLinkedIn has reduced the number of servers from 30 to 3 (almost 90% reduction) since it started using Node.js.\nPayPal reported that after using Node.js, the capacity of handling the number of requests per second has increased twice and the response time of their website is reduced by 35%.\nQuestion no. 3: What can Node.js do?\nAnswer: Here is the list of the activities that Node.js can do:\nIt can create dynamic web page content.\nIt can modify, add and delete data in your database.\nIt can develop highly scalable server-side applications.\nIt can read, write, open, create and close files on the web server.\nIt can build certain types of applications, including Internet Of Things (IoT), data streaming apps, real-time chat apps, microservices architecture and more.\nQuestion no. 4: How is Node.js different from traditional web-scripting?\nAnswer: Let’s understand how Node.js is different from a traditional server-side scripting environment.\nTraditional web-scripting vs Node.js\nTraditional web-scripting:\nTraditional scripting language runs the application using a separate server, such as Apache. It is thread based, and it creates new threads for each client request. This leads to complex debugging and testing processes. Also, the whole thread gets blocked if the process is waiting for Input/Output operations. Look at the image below. It shows that the process needs to wait until the complete execution of the previous process. This consumes a lot of time and energy of the CPU.\nNode.js:\nNode.js has a built-in module called HTTP that runs on a standalone web server. It can handle multiple concurrent requests because it is single-threaded, follows asynchronous programming and event-driven architecture. Unlike traditional web-scripting, Node.js eliminates the waiting time and simply continues with the processing of next requests. This makes it fast and memory efficient.\nQuestion no. 5: Is Node.js faster than using other competitive solutions in the market?\nAnswer: Code is the foremost consideration when developing any application. Node.js will not eliminate the low-performance issue if the developer has not written the code well. However, as compared to Ruby on Rails, it is capable of handling concurrent multiple requests and a massive amount of traffic on a network.\nQuestion no. 6: When shouldn't you use Node.js?\nAnswer: Node.js doesn’t work well with CPU intensive tasks, such as editing audio, graphics or images and scientific apps. It becomes unresponsive and sluggish, blocking incoming requests when it is used for long calculations or graphic operations. This, in turn, slows down the performance.\nQuestion no. 7: What makes Node.js a great choice?\nAnswer: Things that make Node.js a great choice:\nIt is based on asynchronous programming that makes it fast and efficient.\nIt follows event-driven architecture that makes it lightweight and capable of handling multiple concurrent requests, hence making it suitable for IoT, real-time chat apps and more.\nIt is powered by the V8 JavaScript engine that makes it faster than the traditional web-scripting environment.\nIt uses the npm package manager, that helps developers to work faster.\nIn this article, we have already covered asynchronous programming, event-driven architecture, and V8 JavaScript engine. Let’s discuss the npm package manager of Node.js.\nWhat is the npm package manager and how is it helping developers?\nNpm package is the largest system of an open-source library that contains all the files that developers need for Node.js modules. The Node.js community provides built-in modules (called Node.js modules), a functionally organized JavaScript code that developers can use while building Node.js applications. It makes the work of developers much faster.\nNeed help building applications, partner with a nodejs development company like Zibtek. Contact us today!

    "extractedText": "What is UX Testing\nIan J.H Reynolds\nExplore Ian J.H Reynolds' expertise in finance and economics through his insightful articles on market trends, investment strategies, and economic analysis.\nMore posts by Ian J.H Reynolds.\nIAN J.H REYNOLDS\n5 JUN 2020 • 6 MIN READ\nCall it testing and iteration or simply trial and error, nothing’s ever perfect in its first instance. Consider this: Unilever had to go through 45 generations and 449 iterations of a nozzle before they could create the perfect nozzle for collecting detergent powder in a vat without clogging up.\nIt was this rigorous regime of testing again and again that ultimately resulted in the perfect tool for the job. The same holds true for software as well. Your app may look like a million dollars and may have all the features it could possibly offer, but it’s not intuitive or it doesn’t work as it’s supposed to, then it’s just an exercise in futility.\nWhat is UX Testing?\nThe simplest definition of UX or user experience testing is that it's the process through which all of the different elements and aspects of an app are tested to arrive at an iteration that provides the best possible user experience.\nUX testing is obviously not just limited to apps. It’s vital to carry it out on all kinds of software, programs, websites, web apps, etc. The intention is always the same and that’s to create something that does what it’s supposed to do without causing any hassle for users.\nWhy is UX testing important?\nUX testing is important because it provides you with an opportunity to improve your product. You can look at the feedback from users and see what changes need to be made in order to drive growth.\nFor example, if the objective of your app is to get people to purchase your products, you’d obviously want the design and feel of the app to be as conducive to getting people to purchase as possible.\nIn this scenario, UX testing can reveal what needs to be tweaked in order to increase conversions. You can test different designs, color combinations, button placements among a whole host of other things to arrive at the design that’s most likely to get visitors to convert.\nWhat’s the difference between UX and UI?\nIt happens quite often that people get confused between user experience (UX) and user interface (UI), but it's actually quite easy to tell the two apart. User experience is all-encompassing, it relates to the experience that users have when they interact with one or all aspects of your product.\nThe user interface is one of those aspects, specifically, it relates to how information and value is presented to the user. In the case of an app, it’s the design and the visual elements that the user interacts with to extract value from it.\nTesting Methods for User Experience\nThere are several different methods that can be utilized for user experience testing. Each of these methods can be applied to gain valuable insights about every facet of the experience. One or a combination of these methods can be used depending on the nature of the project.\nUser Testing\nThis is one of the most commonly used methods for UX testing. Real users of the app or software are relied upon to test different scenarios. They have to perform different tasks and basically put the app through its paces to figure out if any improvements need to be made.\nUser testing can either be moderated or unmoderated. In the first instance, moderators conduct the proceedings and are on hand to provide explanation and more details about how the product works. The moderator can then look at how the testers react and report back with the findings.\nUnmoderated testing is widely believed to be more effective since it eliminates the possibility of a bias. Testers don't feel like they have someone watching over them, so they can be brutally honest, however, this might leave room for user error during the test which could skew the results.\nSurveys and Polls\nOften an under-utilized method, conducting surveys and polls is another highly effective way of conducting user experience testing. Who better to ask about what pain points need to be addressed then those who use your app on a daily basis?\nWith surveys and polls, actionable qualitative and quantitative data can be collected. There are a variety of ways they can be set up depending on the objective of the test. For example, a survey or poll may only appear when a user displays a certain on-page behavior.\nA/B or Split Testing\nA/B or split testing can prove to be very valuable, particularly if the goal is to increase conversions. It works very well if there’s already an established user base, but there are ways to make it work if you’re just starting out as well.\nThis method basically has users compare two versions of an app against each other. You can split the traffic between both versions and then decide which one converts better.\nDuring testing, the variations are shown at random in order to stabilize the data. Analysis of the results is then conducted to arrive at a definitive conclusion regarding the version that exhibits the best conversions.\nPopular UX Testing Tools for Software\nThere are quite a few tools out there that can help with UX testing regardless of the method that you apply for your particular project. Whether you want to do split testing or surveys and polls, there’s no shortage of software solutions.\nOptimizely\nTake Optimizely for example. It’s a popular A/B testing tool that's recommended because of its user-friendly nature. It offers a wide variety of features like cross-browser testing, mobile website testing, visitor segmentation, geotargeting, and more. It also allows conversion tracking so you can easily figure out which variation is performing the best.\nQualaroo\nIf you feel that surveys and pools are better suited to the kind of results that you're looking for, you can use a tool called Qualaroo. This tool allows you to create surveys and polls that you can have your users answer in real time. It works particularly well for website owners since they can use the feedback to make improvements to their site in order to increase usability.\nIt offers very useful features such as exit surveys, which will provide you with more insight on why your visitors did not convert. It even integrates with CRM solutions like Salesforce so that all of the data can quickly be analyzed and any changes that need to be made can be executed without wasting time.\nUsabilityHub\nYou don't necessarily need to spend a lot of money on a big research firm to carry out testing with real people on your app. You can use a tool like UsabilityHub. It's a remote user research platform which will put your app in front of real users. You will then get to see videos of real people actually testing your app and providing their feedback.\nIt's effectively a Swiss Army knife for remote usability testing. It can provide testers for first click tests, design surveys, preference tests, five-second tests, and more. The possibilities are endless with this one platform.\nSecure proper UX testing for your custom app.\nYou have come to know by now that merely designing the perfect app and filling it with great features isn’t enough. You need to be sure that your users can get the best possible experience out of it, otherwise, all of the work would have been done in vain.\nThat’s only going to be possible if you have robust user experience testing carried out on your app. For that, look no further than Zibtek, which is one of the world’s leading software development companies that provides the same level of exceptional service Fortune 500s to startup companies alike.\nBased in the United States, Zibtek has experienced UX experts on its panel that can perform any method of UX testing on your app while you keep an eye on the results in real-time.

    "extractedText": "PRODUCT MANAGEMENT\nWhat Are The Components Of A Customer Journey Map\nA consumer journey map clearly displays all of the customers' interactions with you. This helps to tell the story about your customer's experiences with your company from the very first interaction into potentially a long-term relationship.\nVedant Vyas\nRead more posts by this author.\nVEDANT VYAS\n17 NOV 2019 • 4 MIN READ\nA consumer journey map clearly displays all of the customers' interactions with you. This helps to tell the story about your customer's experiences with your company from the very first interaction into potentially a long-term relationship.\nDo you have a fundamental understanding of how your customers interact with your software, apps, and websites? It is tempting to assume that their trek through your digital platforms is just like a brick and mortar store: they enter through the front, take a turn, explore a few sections, make a decision, and then head to the checkout.\nUnfortunately, the modern user experience is non-linear. Social media gets involved, multiple entry points are used, and often customers come and go before a transaction takes place. Your goal as a service or product provider is to make sure that existing and potential clients enter your digital realm easily, accomplish what they need to do, and leave with a positive feeling. When developing a new digital platform for customers, understanding what the customer’s journey looks like is a critical step in providing the experience that sets you apart in the marketplace. The first step in gaining that understanding is creating a customer journey map.\nWhen we work with our customers to develop their custom software solutions, we start with a proven consumer journey mapping process. It helps tell the story of your customer’s experiences from the initial interaction to (hopefully) a long-term relationship.\nNine steps to understanding how your customers might interact\nHere is an infographic that we use to show the critical components of a useful customer journey map.\nComponents Of A Customer Journey Map\nYou can also download a printable version as a PDF file[LINK].\nTo help explain these components here is a bit more information on each:\nReview goals\nStart with your organization’s end goals for the product or service you are mapping. Then use those goals to define what you want to achieve with your customer journey mapping effort. These goals will guide your brainstorming and the implementation of what you uncover.\nGather research\nUse the information you already have on the current customer experience. Good and bad, qualitative and quantitative. Look at competitive platforms as well to understand what their customer journey looks like.\nTouchpoints and channels\nWork as a team—a team made up of people from across your organization and your outside consultants—to create a list of customer touchpoints and the channels. The touchpoints are “what” consumers do to interact with your brand. The channels are “how” customers interact: the technologies, locations, and platforms.\nEmpathy map\nHaving captured the “what” and the “how,” the next step is to understand how it feels to interact with your company. Put yourself in the customer’s shoes. Capture a well-rounded sense of what a customer persona might think, feel, see, hear, say, and do as they interact with your firm. Find pain points. Empathy mapping is especially important in industries like healthcare and finance, where you are dealing with people's physical and financial wellbeing.\nBrainstorm with lenses\nImagine what your product will look like by brainstorming solutions for how customers will interact. We have found that brainstorming as a team, using different lenses to look at challenges and solutions from different points of view including the customer’s perspective, can generate a large number of ideas in a short period.\nAffinity diagram\nOrganize the ideas you generated through brainstorming with an affinity diagram to gain valuable insight into typical customer needs. As you are mapping a user journey, group the solutions based on the user's experience and your understanding of the audience you are trying to enable.\nSketch the journey\nPut everything you have learned together in a sketch of the user journey.

    "extractedText": "OFFSHORE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT\nWhy Offshore Software Development Is Your Best Bet?\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n18 APR 2018 • 3 MIN READ\nYou’ve heard horror stories from colleagues about offshore endeavors gone wrong. From companies who boast huge cost savings to companies who advertise “We do Englesh” there is certainly room for error. But what if you found a partner who had spent enough time in the software development saddle to work out the kinks and curate a model for offshore development that actually worked? Too good to be true, right? Wrong.\nZibtek has been in the proverbial saddle for long enough to know what works when it comes to successful offshore software development. Instead of direct-to-India outsourcing, Zibtek’s team includes a US-based project manager for every project to facilitate communication and ensure deliverables at every step of the development process. We have a team of dedicated developers in India, who we’ve built long-term relationships with to make communication easier. This helps us to assign the perfect developers to your project without the need for constant re-vetting.\nHere is why offshore software development continues to be your best bet:\nNo new infrastructure required\nOne huge advantage of hiring an offshore software development company is that you do not need to create and manage a development team at all. Project start-up can takeoff more quickly if you do not need to consider the infrastructure and the setup of your own development center.\nTime zone differences working with people overseas\nThis is a benefit or a problem depending on how you look at it. It is always desirable to have some overlapping between the local and remote work hours so you can meet and resolve issues quickly. Besides that, you may greatly benefit having a team with some hours ahead or behind your local time.\nShared responsibility\nRisk management in software development is usually underestimated by most non-IT companies. When deciding to outsource a given component, the parties agree on what has to be done, and the impact and risk management is shared among them. Managing and mitigating the risks produced by the development can be handled better by the offshore company as it is part of its core business to do so.\nOpen communication\nClear communication in any work environment is paramount but it is especially important when offshoring. You need a partner who speaks clear English, can be available to work during your waking hours and is readily available and responsive to all communication channels.\nZibtek provides a US-based project manager for each software project. This project manager is your liaison between what’s going on stateside and what’s being developed abroad. Using all the latest communication tools and some old trusty’s (can you say smoke signals? Just kidding) we pride ourselves on being super responsive and attentive to Skype messages, email, phone calls, and yes, even smoke signals. Want more on communication best practices? Check out our post on overcoming communication barriers with your offshore team.\nActive Management\nThe next crucial ingredient for offshore development success is continuous and consistent management. We think of this piece as a two-way street. We’ll provide you with daily updates from your developers and full access to our team’s calendars for any time you need. What we need from you is to play an active role in your product’s outcome. If you provide our engineers with plenty of feedback, we’ll deliver exactly what you’re after.\nFinding the Right Partner\nFinally, the most important part of offshore development success is picking the right partner. We know deciding who and where to outsource your development to is a time suck. But, it’s time well spent if you truly vet candidates and find a company that can help you not only develop software but helps scale your business. Maybe your product needs a few tweaks and is a good fit for a local freelancer. Maybe you’re more comfortable having in-house developers work on your core product. And maybe your product is the perfect fit for outsourced software development. If the latter is the case, Zibtek is eager to augment your existing team or to become your full-time development team.\nIf you’d like to learn a little more about Zibtek’s way of doing offshoring right, don’t hesitate to reach out. For lean, agile, rapid development with the hottest coding around, it’s hard to beat outsourcing through Zibtek.\nAt Zibtek, we offer custom software solutions for businesses of all sizes.

    "extractedText": "OFFSHORE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT\nOffshore vs Onshore Custom Software Development\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n16 JUL 2019 • 5 MIN READ\nMost businesses, including everything from multi-national corporations (MNCs) to start-ups, get confused about whether to use onshore software development or offshore software development. Choosing the right one for your project will greatly impact the quality and delivery of your software. In this article, we have explained key considerations about onshore and offshore software development along with their pros and cons.\nTo understand the concept of onshore and offshore software development, it’s important to have knowledge about onshore and offshore software development companies. So, before delving into the pros and cons of both onshore and offshore development, let’s have a look at what the terms ”onshore and offshore development companies” and “onshore and offshore software development” actually mean.\nThe onshore software development company\nOnshore companies are located in the same country in which they are registered. The majority of their businesses are in the country where they also reside and conduct operations. For instance, you are working with an onshore company if your company is registered in the U.S. and your projects are carried out by your team that is also in the U.S.\nFacts about onshore software development companies:\nFor them, tax policies and laws are the same as for other companies in their country.\nOnshore companies are suitable for large enterprises with a swift growth rate that have a large development or designing budget.\nOffshore software development company\nUnlike onshore companies, offshore companies are registered in another country. For instance, you are working with an offshore company if your company is registered in the U.S. and your projects are carried out by a company that is in India.\nFacts about offshore software development companies:\nTheir tax structure is different from onshore companies.\nThey still need to be in full compliance with the law, otherwise they face penalities for noncompliance.\nWhat is offshore software development?\nOffshore software development is an approach followed by the companies in which they outsource their software development project (including web or mobile development) to offshore companies (meaning a team in other countries).\nWith the advancement of technology, it’s now easier to manage business across the world from one location. This idea has originated the concept of offshore software development. Apart from software development, the offshore approach can also be adopted by other fields including business process outsourcing (BPO), knowledge process outsourcing (KPO), data services and more.\nPartnering with an offshore software development company is a cost-effective approach if your outsourcing partner is in a developing country. This is because the labor cost in developing countries (including the Philippines, Ukraine, India, and others) is lower than the developed countries.\nChoosing offshore software development will help your company in the following ways:\nYou can minimize the pressure on your internal development team, hence they can focus on other productive work.\nYou don’t need to hire a large number of employees at your premises, hence saving a huge amount of money.\nPros of offshore software development:\nThe global pool of talent\nThe offshore software development approach provides you the opportunity to have access to the global talent pool across the world.\nHire employees as long as you need them\nOffshore software development lets you hire people as long as you need them for your project. It’s the responsibility of offshore companies to scale up or scale down the team according to the project requirement.\nOffshore companies usually have a larger workforce (especially in countries like the Philippines, India, Ukraine, and Pakistan) because of their low costs. Their turn-around time is also less. Therefore, this approach is well-suited if you need to complete your project on a tight timeline.\nLow cost\nIn developing countries, it's easy to find qualified professionals who can develop the software within your budget. Low labor cost is the main advantage of offshore software development. The cost of living varies from country to country. This means the money you are paying to the offshore company is low for you, but it may be high for them.\nCons of offshore software development:\nCommunication barrier\nSometimes, real-time communication is the main hurdle with offshore companies, as they often have a different time zone. For instance, if you drop an e-mail, then you may have to wait for a whole day to get a reply from them. This communication gap consumes so much of your time and it becomes frustrating at times. Also, there will be no face-to-face meetings. To discuss project goals and objectives, you have to rely on conference calls. Sometimes, it can impact the level of understanding (meaning you can misinterpret some things) between the two parties.\nWhat is onshore software development?\nIn the onshore software development approach, you assign the software development project to your internal development team or local contractors who reside in the same region where you run your business. The major benefit of the onshore software development approach is that face-to-face meetings can easily be arranged with the team to drill into the details of the project.\nPros of onshore software development:\nSmooth flow of communication\nUnlike offshore companies, onshore companies have the same time zone, resulting in clearer and smoother communication. You can get quick replies to your messages and emails because office hours of the employees are generally almost the same.\nAlso, you can easily conduct face-to-face meetings to discuss project initiatives and objectives. Therefore, there will not be any communication gap between the two parties, leading to a good level of understanding.\nHigh quality solution\nIn onshore software development, a collaboration between design and development teams is easy. This, in turn leads to successful delivery of a high-quality project on time.\nCons of onshore software development:\nHigh cost\nOpting for onshore software development can be expensive because:\nThe ‘you get what you pay for’ concept: to get high-quality software, you need to invest more.\nYou may need to hire some extra professionals for your project, bearing the cost of managing a large number of employees.\nHelpful tips on how to choose between onshore and offshore\nThese days, enterprises are outsourcing their projects to offshore companies to deliver high-end solutions. Industry leaders (including IBM, Wipro, Infosys) also rely on offshore software development for some of their projects.\nOnshore software development is known for high-quality solutions but it is costly. While offshore development is inexpensive, choosing the right offshore development partner (who can build a quality solution within a certain deadline) is challenging. If you want to know the useful tips on how to choose the right software development partner, check out this link: https://www.zibtek.com/blog/how-to-choose-a-software-development-partner/\nChoosing between onshore and offshore software development is a critical decision for your business. Before deciding between these two, you should estimate the cost of your software project. It will help you to decide which one (between onshore or offshore) is better for your business.\nLook at the software project estimation process given below.\n(image credit: clutch.co)\nFactors to consider before making decision between onshore and offshore software development:\nFirst, plan your budget by estimating the cost of your software project,\n2. Then, carefully consider the pros and cons of onshore and offshore development.\n3. After weighing out the pros and cons, compare them to your budget and project timeline, and make the decision accordingly. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

Prep chefs are the first hands on your meal–cutting vegetables, trimming meat or baking bread. Next, an expediter will call in your order once it’s received from the server to alert the cooks of what’s coming up that they’ll need to prepare. Then, line cooks or sous chefs will grab the necessary prepped ingredients, season them and take them to the flame! Once all the ingredients are cooked to perfection, the head chef will masterfully plate your meal with artistic flare and make sure your items are the correct temperature. Once it’s ready to be devoured, your server will be beckoned by the kitchen to deliver your meal. How does it taste? Amazing! It had better taste good for a $40 entree…\nNow that you’re belly is full, you don’t mind a 20-30 minute wait for a delicious dinner. But what if you had to wait 50-60 minutes? Would you be willing to wait that long for dinner? The only way restaurants can get their customers food out in an acceptable time frame is to utilize several people with differing skills. For example, you wouldn’t want the Dish Washer cooking your tenderloin. So the restaurant uses the cooks with the greatest knife skills to prep, the greatest saute skills to line cook and the most culinary knowledge to plate and finish your dish. Having multiple cooks in the kitchen is just like managing multiple developers on one project. It saves time and allows each developer to work on the piece of the project that they are the best fit for.\nWhile utilizing multiple developers for one project sounds like a disaster waiting to happen to some, to others it sounds like a great way to get a whole project completed at twice the speed!\nWorking multiple developers in one project is done all the time by companies of all sizes with even remote employees too. Version control systems, project management tools, and repositories make managing multiple developers much easier than it may sound.\nOur team uses GitHub. It’s a version/revision control system (VCS) that allows our developers to have control over any changes to the source code. Other popular VCS’s are Subversion, Mercurial, and Bazarr. Project management tools are commonly used in combination with VCS to keep communication amongst the development team open and also to track bugs.\nHow it’s Done\nIf all of your developers have commit access to the repository, they will pull changes from it, make their own changes, locally commit, and then push back into the main repository when they have working code.\nPhoto by Tim van der Kuip / Unsplash\nIf you have several developers who are responsible for committing to the repository, then you need to have each of them clone the repository into their own accounts and have them send pull requests when they have a change they want to send into the main repository. Our team has found that each developer needs their own GitHub account. These separate accounts can be set up as collaborators so they can all have commit access.\nFor features or fixes that will require more than one commit, use branches. This way, more than one developer can be working on a branch at the same time. You can clone a specific feature as well. By utilizing the pull request workflow mentioned above, you can add changes to the main repository when your feature is complete.\nTricks of the Trade\nAvoid corrupting the project by respecting each developer’s work items and ensure that no single object is being changed at the same time.\nCreate a work item before making changes to an object\nNever work on someone else’s item until they have released it\nSave the project once you’re done working on an object and then release the item\nDo not rename work items without notifying your team\nBefore you start a new development task always save and reload\nVersion control DOES NOT replace communication. Try a real-time communication medium like Slack or Skype groups\nWrite detailed check in comments about changes you’ve made for the other developers on your team.\nIf you need a little more convincing check out what the spiceworks community has to say about managing multiple developers on the same project at the same time. You don’t expect one chef to cook your entire meal at a restaurant, so don’t expect one developer to work your entire codebase.\nAt Zibtek, we offer custom software solutions for businesses of all sizes.

Yes, they’re still a big deal—so much so that the website user experience can determine whether your business succeeds or fails. They’re also one of the best tools you have for proactively promoting your mobile apps, products, and services across multiple platforms to help them penetrate the market.\nAnd those mobile apps you're promoting? They, too, need to offer positive UX experiences that meet people where they are on whichever device they choose.\nProviding your audience with great web experiences:\nBoosts customer retention.\nReduces future development costs.\nIncrease ROI.\nGives you a competitive edge.\nProviding your audience with a great experience on your website helps:\nBoost customer retention.\nReduce future development costs.\nIncrease ROI.\nGive you a competitive edge.\nA website user experience audit analyzes your site and pinpoints which areas disrupt the user flow and derail conversions.\nWeb Apps vs. Mobile Apps\nSome people say that social media apps like Snapchat, Tiktok, and Instagram have made web apps irrelevant; in our humble opinion, those people are wrong.\nSure, social media is fun, and it’s great for generating brand buzz. But buzz isn’t always lasting, and it rarely goes very far in helping you establish trust with potential customers. And that’s a key distinction, because engaging and entertaining people on social media platforms is one thing, but controlling the messaging is only truly possible with your website and web apps.\nPlus, custom web applications allow you to communicate more effectively and efficiently with your customers. They also help you get real-time customer feedback so you can identify issues and trends that are affecting their overall experience with your company.\nWell-designed websites and web apps that offer users satisfying experiences also make it easier to keep pace with your business as it grows and changes. Finally, the dynamic experience web apps provide make people feel valued, thereby increasing customer loyalty.\nHow Do I Evaluate the User Experience of My Website?\nUndergoing a Website User Experience Audit\nWhy is there such a gap between what people want from a website and what developers deliver? How is it that the same elements that annoy users on one site appear so often on others? Have designers forgotten the website user experiences (UX) that annoy them?\nProbably not, but what can happen is that business owners and development teams at some point in the design process begin to shift their focus from UX to workable features.\nAs with financial audits, a website user experience audit paves the way to achieving better results. During a UX audit, we use various tools, methods, and metrics to see where things are going right or wrong.\nWe start by diving deep into what you want your website to achieve for your business. Most companies want their sites to help them increase sales and revenues, drive more conversions, and improve customer satisfaction (a little later on, we’ll discuss why this last goal should be the first!)\nNext up is your audience or users. Discovering who they are and what they need helps us better understand what improvements and recommendations will positively affect the UX.\nWe then move on to examining the user flow. Now that pain points have been identified, it’s time to look at how users navigate your website and which actions get them where they want to be. This can sometimes involve the site’s entire architecture being mapped out.\nTo learn why people aren’t converting, we review and analyze historical data from sales, search, social, and other traffic sources. By studying trends, patterns, and metrics, we’re able to see how well individual pages are performing, including at the top and bottom of the funnel.\nA comprehensive direct and non-direct competitor analysis lets us see how other similar businesses have applied website solutions for problems like yours.\nEvaluating a website’s user interface (UI) helps identify inconsistencies and flaws in the site’s visual design. We talk about the synchronicity between UX and UI in the next section.\nA good website audit also looks at accessibility features that make a website easy to use regardless of disabilities or special needs.\nThe final step is looking at your website’s speed and performance, which is a huge factor in whether people hang around long enough to discover what makes your brand so awesome. eCommerce websites really need to be on top of speed, as users tend to drop out of the funnel if product or checkout pages take longer than three seconds to load.\nHow to Improve Website User Experience\n“The customer experience begins with user experience” is something most businesses say they agree with yet rarely take to heart. How else can you explain the number of horrendous websites out there making people frustrated and annoyed?\nAs we alluded earlier, the website user experience should be your top priority. Still, far too often, owners, developers, and other stakeholders develop shiny object syndrome, where they hyper-focus on things like fonts, colors, and images. Not that your site doesn’t need those elements, but functionality, smooth navigation, and usability are what keep people staying long enough to discover who you are and what you offer.\nIt's a simple concept that can be difficult to master: The easier your website is to use, the more people will use it. And to do that, you need to make navigation intuitive, like placing “Contact” buttons up in the right-hand corner.\nTo illustrate what happens when you try to be, as they say, too clever by half:\nHave you ever rushed up to a door and given it a hearty push, only to realize you were supposed to pull? Have you LOLed when you’ve seen someone else do it? That’s what’s known as the “Norman door” effect, where design elements give users indications to do one thing, but the result is not what was expected—like doors that, based on experience, signal push but don’t budge.\nSo, how do you ensure your website delivers experiences people actually enjoy?\nBegin by making sure UX and UI work together. It’s not good enough to only know the user and what they want from a website experience; you must also help them navigate and complete their goals with the use of visual design.\nUser Experience Website Checklist\nHow Do I Evaluate the User Experience of My Website?\nAverage Cost for UX Website Design\nLike most things, what you pay for UX website design depends on things like the scope of your project, how much testing’s involved, and the designer’s expertise. That means, in most cases, timelines, benchmarks, and costs are estimated. Working with a highly experienced website design company can eliminate much of the guesswork, but there are still variables that can impact your final price.\nThe thing to know is that quality UX website design can be time-consuming. But when you consider what the final product does, such as engage users, drive conversions, and deliver a remarkable ROI, it’s nearly always worth the investment.\nThe bottom line? The cost of UX website design may be steep, but quality UX is priceless. Ready to learn more? Schedule a meeting with us today. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

Having a tool to resolve this problem would be great. There are so many excellent tools that are available which can address some of the issues. Unfortunately, we have not yet found a tool which can address all of them.\nUnderstanding the Design-Development Gap\nIn a nutshell, the gap we are talking about is nothing but the gap in communication between the designers and the developers. You will encounter this problem during the product development process.\nIf the waterfall process dominates your company, you will definitely face this problem. The main reason why this might happens is because the designer thinks his work is complete once the design is ready. He hands the design to the developer with no intention of working on it again as he put so much time and effort into creating it. The developer might not like the design as it does not match his requirement. This issue can be solved easily if there is proper communication between both the parties. A communication gap can cause confusion as the developer does not understand the real intent of the design.\nIt not only create chaos, but it can also cause several other failures. For example, it can give space for off-brand animations and links that are terrible. You might see rounded corners as they can be a pixel or 50 off the mark. These things can take a toll on web development or a software development project.\nIf you assume that the design-development gap plagues only the waterfall teams, you are wrong. Any organization can encounter this kind of obstacle when there is a lack of experience as well as mutual effort.\nKey Problems You Might Face\nIssues that come from this design-development gap are numerous. These are some of the main problems that your team might encounter.\nProblem 1 – Not Knowing the Limitations\nAnyone who knows CSS pretty well also knows the limitations of it. It is quite evident that you cannot create everything using CSS. However, some designers do not know the limitations of it. They juggle a lot to ensure that they get the design that they want. To achieve this, they might make the designs using Photoshop or Sketch and assume that it is easy to bring it to the web. In reality, this is nearly impossible.\nBridging the gap here includes helping the designer understand the capabilities of CSS. It is the only way he will avoid designing an impossible solution.\nProblem 2- Documentation That Consumes Time\nThe best way to bridge the gap between the design-development gap is to maintain proper documentation. Redlines, component diagrams as well as spec docs are some of the documents you need to maintain. You might call them by different names, but the purpose of the documents is the same.\nThese tasks seem to be time-consuming even though some of them bring value. Generally speaking, almost all the digital products benefit a lot when you use documentation related to the design, language, and development.\nRedlines, for example, can take a lot of your time and effort to create, therefore, check and remove the documentation that is not necessary. It is best for you to find ways to find the fastest as well as the easiest ways to document.\nProblem 3 – Lengthy Feedback Process\nFeedback is one thing that is inevitable and is valuable. Even when the designers have CSS at the forefront of their minds and even when they document all the details. If the loop is too long, it can negatively affect employee morale, and it can also drain most of your resources. It is common for you to also receive different feedback from different people. Engineers can lose sight of the overarching strategy, especially in meetings when the stakeholders disagree with one another. It is imperative for you to find ways to remove the additional feedback loop.\nWays to Bridge the Gap Between Design and Development\nYou can easily understand the nature of the problems that one can encounter during the design-development process. There are a great many tools to help resolve the problems that you encounter. However, the best way to resolve most of the issues is by improving the communication across the teams. Digital tools can be of help to a point, but you should rely more on interpersonal skills. Now, here are the tips that can help you solve many problems at the initial stage:\nTip 1: Early Communication Is the Key\nDesigners and developers need to work together from the time they begin the project. It means a lot more than communicating on the GitHub tickets or sharing files on Sketch.\nDesigners should talk about their designs to the developers. Let them look at the designs at an early stage and point out the gray areas. Find and finalize ways that will work well for you with regards to communication. Use various communication channels to discuss several things including specs and changes. Now, your communication can be a lot more effective when you take care of these items.\nTip 2 – Adopt Agile Design\nBeing agile can help more in eradicating communication problems than you might think. You need to have people working in cross-functional teams. Involve people who have specialties in various streams of a process. It can help them significantly to understand the process and erase the problems right when they are budding. Both the designers and developers will be able to communicate better with each other as a result.\nTip 3- Speak their Language\nDesigners and developers should know each other’s work to some extent as it can help open up a dialogue between them. It does not mean the developers should know how to code. It is helpful if they know how to do it as it can help them to share insights that can greatly assist the designer. In the same manner, a designer needs to understand what a developer can do. Knowing the possibilities of what a developer can do with the interface can be quite helpful to the designer.

Perhaps at no other time in history was it possible to find the freedom and support that we currently have through the digital global economy. There are so many fields out there where you can start an initiative. Unfortunately, despite these advantages, almost 90% of the startups fail. The reason why this happens is that people do not do the proper groundwork before launching a product or service.\nWhen it comes to IT product development, there are three main steps. First, have a proof of concept; next, build a product prototype; and third MVP launch and testing. Only after completing these three tasks, you can work on full-fledged product development. These steps are critical if you want to launch a successful IT product.\nWhy You Need to Validate A Business Idea\nNo matter how great your vision is, if there is no traction, it is bound to fail. Only when investors can see the evidence of traction, they will be ready to invest their money. Investors understand the concept that you need to build your business around a demand rather than on an existing product.\nValidation has the power to detach your emotions from the idea and view it objectively. The best way to achieve this is by leveraging outside feedback. You can obtain feedback from representatives of your target audience as well as field experts.\nStep 1. Proof of Concept\nDuring this process, you need to put your startup idea aside. Think about your target audience and their experience. You will gain significant insights into how they view your product. It is also the best way to analyze the product if they find it attractive and necessary. Start your info-gathering by carrying out a feasibility study of the problem your product is going to solve. And try to gather the answers to these four critical questions:\nHow are people solving this problem now?\nWho exactly are my competitors?\nIn what ways is my solution going to be better?\nWhat are some ways the solution I am going to give is different from others?\nYour assumptions are now closer to reality than before. Since they are still assumptions, you need a target audience to check them for you. As an entrepreneur, you can find so many tools that can assist you in collecting feedback from users. These tools include extensive market research, spreadsheets, landing pages, interviews, email distribution, etc.\nFor example, if you want to receive feedback on a mobile game you are planning to develop invite players to participate in giving your inputs as early as the graphic design development phase. You will be surprised to see the number of unique responses that you will get. This strategy also helps you create brand awareness among the people as well as attract innovators and early adopters.\nWhen You Should Build a Product Prototype\nA prototype is the simplest working interactive model of the end product that you are going to create. It can help communicate both the design and functionality aspects to the future clients, investors and other stakeholders. But the primary function of the prototype is the visualization of the idea that you have. You can use it to check your theories in practice. When you test the prototype, you might come across various new ideas which have useful functionality.\nYou can also determine the problem zones early on. It costs you less to fix most of the errors and make the necessary changes during this initial stage. When you have a proper prototype testing in place, you can very well begin to develop an MVP, which is a barebones form of your end product.\nDeveloping the MVP\nDuring the initial stage of the development, a prototype assists in fixing many problems. But an MVP is explicitly designed to identify the end user’s reactions when you launch the actual product for real-life testing. Employing a professional team is vital when you are creating an MVP as it is a real product.\nRecognise the fact that there are hundreds of apps and services developed and released every month in the market. The product needs to look great if you want to beat the competition. It is essential for you to understand that the customers are not going to give you an exception just because you are “trying something new.”\nIf you fail to deliver the best product, they may simply choose your competitor’s product. That’s why you need to take an MVP seriously. You can’t just launch a loppy version of your final product. It needs to be a properly designed working product even though it has only limited functionality.\nThese are the three significant steps that you need to take to validate the business idea of your product. Following these steps, you will quickly realize if your idea has market potential without spending much. Idea validation is crucial as it can help you to remove the errors and features that are not great. It is the best way to enhance your overall product before you launch it. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

    "extractedText": "BUSINESS\nProduct Management Tips For Enterprises\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n19 SEP 2018 • 3 MIN READ\nAs a product manager, you need to have many skills at your disposal. Product strategy, design-oriented thinking, engineering processes, documentation, execution, and feedback are some of the most critical tools you need to possess. Without these skills, it is tough for you to keep the team motivated and focused on the vision for the product. Any lack of these also means you’ll struggle to keep deliveries rolling.\nIt might be one of the reasons why that the internet is bombarded with a massive number of quality resources that assist product managers. It is also no wonder that people are crazy about becoming a product manager. People with excellent experience as product managers are climbing up the ladder by taking on the roles of prominent executive positions in tech companies.\nMost product management resources are geared heavily towards consumer technology. Uber, Etsy, Amazon, Twitter and even Google are all focusing on consumer technology. There are many consumer product managers in the market because of the many consumer web companies. Though these roles are pretty impressive, as an enterprise product manager, you should probably do things differently.\nBusiness Models Determine the Flow\nThe difference between consumer and enterprise software is apparent. But the impact these differences have on a product management function can vary. There are many flavors that come with consumer technology. Marketplaces, affiliate models, ad-supported and direct sales are some of them.\nMost of them are businesses based on a model of scale. The goal is to reach the largest audience possible. The number of customers in a scale business is massive, and you need to keep them in mind when you make the product, pricing, support, technology, and other vital business decisions.\nBut in the enterprise world, you operate almost entirely on direct sales or subscription model. And here the scale matters but is not the most important factor. The products that enterprise-level business-to-business marketers sell are more sophisticated, and sellers target only a small group of paying customers who are often big and complex. It is pretty cumbersome and painful for most of the companies to purchase, implement and then begin to use new software.\nFirstly, a resource discussion needs to take place internally. After which there needs to be an allocation of the budget. Once these steps are complete, they make sales calls and negotiate the prices before the contract is signed. Training the staff is mandatory before the team begins to use the product. This whole process is called the implementation process.\nAs an enterprise product manager, it is essential for you to work closely with sales and marketing teams. It requires you to go with them to a client’s or prospective client’s offices to close the deal. In some cases just to get some feedback. Since in sales at this level you only have a few customers, you need to work with them to ensure that they are willing to invest a significant amount in your product.\nThough sales support is part of the job, it should not become the main focus of the product manager. The priority of the product manager should be on long-term product development.\nSlow and Steady Wins the Race\nSince most of the big companies invest a significant amount in your product, they do not expect unannounced and unexpected changes to the product. It is good to upgrade the system promptly but ensure that there are no bugs in the software. It is true especially if your product is business critical like digital analytics, marketing intelligence, and e-commerce platforms. If these systems go down, it is not only annoying but will cause loss of business. Customers mostly expect the product always to be available especially when it is a cloud-based application.\nProduct delivery for the enterprise customers requires you to plan a lot. There should be coordination and hard work put in by various teams which also need a product manager to lead the show. Though it is quite stressful, the work can be gratifying.\nUnderstanding Minimum Viable Product\nCreate something that is basic and iterates until it becomes an excellent product. This conceptual model is best and provides intuitive sense. It is one of the good frameworks that you need to embrace if you are creating a mobile app or a consumer service. This model, however, does not work for enterprise software.\nLand and expand strategy works well for enterprise platforms. Using this framework, you will first try to solve a set of problems for the user. Once you are comfortable resolving some issues, you may expand the features to address other significant issues. These days, many major companies dislike buying widgets as they expect well-baked solutions to the business problems that they are facing.\nThorough understanding of use cases and business problems is a must to know users’ business problems. Solving simple business problems is just not enough to set you apart in a large field of business-to-business sellers aimed at enterprise companies. You need to solve the tougher challenges that your customers are facing. To create a product like this requires you to do proper research and focus on the details. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

    "extractedText": "BUSINESS\nTop Questions You Need To Ask A Software Development Agency Before Working With Them\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n17 SEP 2018 • 3 MIN READ\nIt’s easy to see that we are surrounded by digital products today. While some of these products easily surpass the three-year mark, many of them fail before reaching that. There are countless reasons why a product succeeds or fails. If you are on a quest to develop an app or website or planning to work with IoT, you need to know all your options before proceeding.\nWhen you are in a situation in which you don’t have sufficient help from your in-house (or you may be small enough that you don’t even have an in-house tech team), you may choose to take advice from the outside. But many people find it hard to decide on a potential partner. It is essential for you to ask them some questions to determine the right candidate for your unique project.\nQuestion 1: What is the process that you follow when you create a product?\nYou have to first understand the objective of what you are planning to build and this is the first aspect that you need to consider. It is imperative for companies to give agencies all the required information, including business goals, that are necessary to build the product.\nAgencies should know that their work is not 100% complete once the client launches the product. It shouldn’t be, as the users and data analysis team can only offer certain feedback after the product is rolled out on the market. Marketing, design and development teams should not be working without technical assistance. Organizations need to maintain fluid communication with each other. This way they can organize their tasks and objectives well.\nIt is quite common in the design phase to observe shifts in the product’s end goal. When this kind of situation arises, agencies should be ready to adapt to the changing needs. They should be able to restructure the whole process to get the best possible result.\nQuestion 2: Who are previous clients?\nOne of the best ways to get to know the agencies you planning to work is to ask whom they have worked with before. You will know how they handled the challenges that they faced during the process and get a sense of how the final products turned out. Creating a great product is impossible without the agencies gaining experience and learning lessons from the mistakes that they made in the past. The reason why you need to do this is that you do not want the agencies to make any significant errors while they are working on your product. You also want assurance that the development team is competent in the expertise required for your product by comparing your plans with what they have accomplished.\nQuestion 3: What do your clients think about you?\nYou definitely want to get references from clients to understand what their previous and existing clients have to say about the company. Choose to use review sites like Clutch to find out more about clients. You should consider conducting phone interviews with both previous and current clients to gain some knowledge of how the firm works, notable strengths and weaknesses.\nQuestion 4: Are you working with User Research and User Testing?\nUser research and user testing are the two most important aspects of development for the product to become successful. When you are building any new product, it is essential for the designer and developer to offer the users experiences that are a great fit for the needs of the users. Getting into the user’s shoes by researching and testing is essential. It is necessary for you to polish usability and the whole UX experience if you want to add value to the product that you create.\nQuestion 5: What Is Your technology stack and development process?\nSince building a product requires you to invest money, you need to make sure that it is generating long-term revenue. Though the product you create will help you get started, you need to understand how the agency made it.\nThe first thing that you need to ensure is that the code is readily available for everyone on the team to check. Secondly, the development team needs to test the code before publishing it on a user-visible version. The agency needs to be open to feedback and make necessary changes. You need to find an agile company, which has a development process that they build around techniques that can provide business value in a short period of the time.\nQuestion 6: What projects are you are working on now?\nThe product can only be successful when the agency has an interest in your company from the day you went and knocked on their door. They need to be eager to help you and your product to succeed. When you see that an agency has a lot of clients, it is an indication that they are in demand. But, if you find them interested in you even when they are busy with other’s work, it tells you that they are capable of handling more significant projects.\nThese are some questions that you need to ask when you are searching for a top software development agency.

You’ve invested countless hours vetting candidates, getting them up to speed on your product(s), paying them a hefty wage, and now they tell you they’re out the door. Why is getting good tech talent to stick around so hard?\nIn the mind of a software developer, salary does not prove worth. Rather, skills, experience, and opportunity showcase a great developer.\n“Your biggest retention risk is a bored developer. The thing that drives software developers is picking up new skills and proving themselves on a bigger and bigger scale.”\nLuke Melia, co-founder of Yapp Inc argues\nDoes your company offer tech employees a robust training program? How about access to the latest and greatest technologies? Because developers don’t just look for the highest paying job, it’s a good idea to offer non-monetary perks. The best software developers are looking for an opportunity to be exposed to new hardware, software, and any new tech they can get their hands on.\nIf you’ve been working with the same software developer or team of developers you are in one of two situations. The first being that you’ve got a great product that is constantly being iterated on using new technologies. Your developers feel challenged by their daily tasks and accomplished when they’ve successfully completed them. If this is you, congratulations! The second scenario is a little drabber. Your tried and true developer(s) are still working for your company, where both parties feel comfortable. “Comfortable” may as well be the kiss of death. If developers are comfortable, they aren’t challenged which will eventually lead to unengaged and thus, no longer employed… by you that is. They’ll find another company, using up-and-coming technology where they have a new skillset to master. Skills mastery in the developer world proves worth and let’s face it, everyone no matter what their skill, is trying to prove their worth.\nAll of this said, you have to be wondering, “Should I be using in-house developers at all?” The answer to that question is: it depends on your product, situation, and budget. However, there are some serious advantages to outsourced software development that you may be missing out on. Because we know that keeping developers happy takes more than just pocket change, maybe it’s time to consider the advantages of outsourcing development to another team, maybe even in another country.\nSome of the key advantages of offshore software development being:\nNo investment in training or equipment\nExperience with all the newest technologies\nOutside companies are constantly searching to hire top developer talent\nGet the developer skills you need for your specific project\nZibtek has worked with several companies who have experienced this conundrum firsthand. These companies began to feel like they could not compete with the benefits of outsourced development. The team at Studio, an app that advertises to do for design what Instagram did for photography,said,\n“We had a hard time keeping our top developers as they continued to seek new opportunities to make more money and learn new technology stacks. We looked into offshoring, found the model that worked and now have a rockstar team that is there to help us hit our long-term goals.”\nAnother client of Zibtek’s, Molio, is a full-service video agency who has great things to say about how they made offshore software development work for their team. “We couldn’t compete with the competitive US market for software engineers, offshoring became to be the best option. As soon as we found the right team, we quickly realized that offshoring done right rocks!”\nWith so many companies struggling to retain developers, it’s no wonder that offshore software development is becoming more popular. If you’re ready to take the plunge and get started with an outsourced developer, consider a partner who can take your product to the next level. Zibtek offers US-based project management for each client’s project, helping you communicate clearly and easily and getting you the best bang for your buck.\nAt Zibtek, we offer custom software solutions for businesses of all sizes.

Besides creating the estimate, it is vital for you to explain the logic behind it. Considering the factors that go into cost estimation, forecasting the weather is sometimes an easier task than estimating software development cost.\nTo generate an accurate estimate, you need to dissect the project work into individual components and then estimate both the timeline and appropriate cost for those components. Keep in mind there are a number of variables that are subjective, meaning you need to factor additional time into your estimate. Without wiggle room or structured flexibility, you very well may set your project up for failure.\nGenerally speaking, the software development methodology that you choose won’t matter much. Teams use various methods such as Waterfall, Agile and some combination of other popular methods. In some cases, the project forecast can challenge the technology and engineering teams, and estimates that are inaccurate may also cause problems for the business.\nHere are some insights we have learned that can help you generate better software development estimates:\nNo 1 – Understanding the Need\nBefore you move to the estimation, it is necessary for you to understand the product concept. You should ask a lot of questions to the client before kicking off your project. It is necessary that you have a sound understanding of the target audience and the problems they face. You should know how the product is going to help fix their problem.\nNo 2- Decode the Features\nOnce you have the necessary information on hand, it is best to decode the features. To put it simply, start to break down all large tasks into smaller ones. We begin to decompose the tasks as per the following structures:\nEpics> User Stories>Use Cases.\nEpics: Epics are large, coarse-grained user stories. They are a placeholder for detailed stories, as they help sketch a feature or larger piece of functionality. Epics permit you to create product functionality without you having to commit to the details. It is useful particularly for the new products and major project updates. It gives you the necessary time to learn more about the users and their needs. They assist in articulating the vision well. In fact, they give the necessary context to the team to create solutions that are impactful.\nUser Story: User stories are critical to understanding what the client requires. You can guess what he expects at a given point. They help you know how the target audience will behave when using the software. You can build the features of the software as per the list you have compiled.\nUse Cases: Once you have the user stories, you need to work on building a list of features. Especially focus on detailing features that will make the software easy to use. Prepare it from an end user’s perspective so that they do not face any challenges in navigating the product.\nNo 3- Understand Cost Implications\nThere will be times when a client will demand a particular system functionality. If people present him with a much better or an alternate approach, he might choose not to listen. Unless someone feels responsible and shares with the client about the cost implications, he might not understand the problem. Only after he clearly understands the costs for the function, he might change his demand. The team then can come to a reasonable solution with ease. If you practice the habit of give-and-take in forming estimates from the beginning, it will help in driving more realistic expectations.\nNo 4 – Involve Business Stakeholders In the Software Estimation Process\nInvolving the business stakeholders in the estimation process is a win for everyone. They can assist in defining things that are critical to the software development cycle. Business leaders and technology teams can gain a shared understanding of the project. The best part is that everyone who is part of this meeting is accountable for the initial estimate.\nNo 5 – Use Analogous Estimation\nTeams combine various estimation methods to make a precise estimate. Using analogous estimation is wise as you can use a measure from a similar project that you did earlier. It will assist you in estimating the cost and the duration of the project much better.\nThis kind of approach works well only when the tasks in the project are identical to the ones you did earlier. If you have never built all the features, you may choose the judgment estimation approach.\nNo 6 – Leverage Expert Judgement in the Estimation\nAn expert or a group of experts who have vast experience should work on creating an expert judgment estimation. The whole process of expert judgment estimation is iterative. An expert or experts typically are individuals with 10+ years of experience and have spent a lot of time in preparing estimates in the past. They are able to re-leverage past research. Following this process, the project manager should meet the experts to review the scope of work.\nThe final review process will come from the client. The client should review the scope of work and provide commentary. Encourage clients to add or remove features which do not align with the scope or are prohibitively expensive from a cost or time perspective. The best estimates will produce results on time and in-budget.\nFor stress free cost estimation try out our Cost Estimator Tool LinkedIn Twitter Email"

Most of your worries will all boil down to one thing.\nCommunication\nYou know what you want. You know there are great developers halfway around the globe who can deliver what you want on the budget and timeline you need.\nYou just don’t know how to get them to do it, what with linguistic barriers, time zone differences, and varied cultural approaches to the collaboration process getting in the way. These problems, if not addressed by having effective communication channels and practices in place, will eat away all of the cost and time savings outsourcing is supposed to bring.\nCommunication with our offshore developers should involve three major features.\nOnshore Management for Offshore Devs\nThere’s simply no replacement for project leaders that share your culture, your language, and your timezone (or are at most only a few hours off). When management knows, in unequivocal terms, what the deliverables are and when they need to be delivered, the project flows more smoothly.\nYou want to outsource your development, not your control or your awareness. A US-based project manager or management team will keep you informed and keep your development on track while allowing you to speak directly with your development personnel as needed. This split gives you the skill and savings on the one hand and the confidence and ease of communication on the other—the best of both worlds.\nClear Communication Processes for All Project Members\nEveryone makes assumptions. Without them, we’d spend way too much time clarifying obvious details and micromanaging—or being micromanaged.\nOf course, assumptions vary from culture to culture, so sometimes greater clarity is needed. And any project that involves multiple teams working separately but in tandem needs excellent communication processes in place to sort out the easily-handled assumptions from those that need to be checked, and to do the checking.\nClear expectations for all communications, from daily standups to demos of key milestones to sprint goals, will keep your project’s rhythm flowing and keep your development cycle turning smoothly.\nLong-Term Relationships with Your Outsourcing Team\nNothing beats experience, and the longer a partnership lasts the more seamless and reliable it becomes. You get to know the ins and outs of working together, and both you and your developers are able to get more value out of the collaboration.\nThough you might only have short-term or intermittent needs for an offshore development team, there are ways you can tap into the power of long-term relationships.\nZibtek’s team brings US-based project managers and leaders together with a dedicated team of offshore developers, some of whom we’ve been working with for over 14 years. We know our team personally, we’re onsite with them regularly, and together we’ve completed over thirty MVPs in the past 18 months alone.\nBuilding the right communication with your offshore, outsourced developers can take time, or you can have it up and running in minutes with Zibtek.

You’ve also heard the horror stories of people who decided to “save money” with offshore assistance and ended up all but destroying their companies with delays, cost overruns, bad work product, or a complete failure to deliver. Given this conflicting information, it’s little wonder that you’re still on the fence when it comes to the idea of working with an international team of developers and software engineers.\nThe problems with traditional offshore development methods are legion, it’s true.\nCommunication difficulties, cultural differences, lack of day-to-day oversight, and other problems can quickly offset any upfront cost-savings you were expecting. This situation leaves you not only paying more but uncertain of the results you can expect or when you can expect them. There’s a lack of control and a lack of accountability in the typical approach to offshore mobile, web, and software development; the traditional way of outsourcing development tasks is high-risk and low-reward. Thankfully, we didn’t get successful by doing things the traditional way, and our clients definitely appreciate the difference.\nZibtek Offers Real Management of Real Offshore Talent\nCommunication is paramount to any collaborative process, and offshore software development is no exception—in fact, there’s hardly a better example of the importance of communication. Whether it’s a simple web development project, native mobile app development for an existing program, or full-scale software engineering from the ground up, Zibtek has a team of top international talent ready to take on your development project. Our US-based project managers have communication processes in place to ensure that developer teams clearly understand the goals and timeline of our client’s projects.\nWe make sure our clients are an integral part of the process and are kept in the loop with weekly “standups” (meetings so short you don’t have time to sit down) that provide a progress update. Of course, longer discussions are had as necessary to sort out project details and deliver the results you need. Our large and well-managed talent network also enables us to assign tasks effectively, using people with the strongest skill sets in the areas and technologies you need at each step along the way rather than forcing you to use a “jack of all trades” for all elements of your development or software build. You get expertise and efficiency you can count on, without the in-house expense of a full development team.\nFinally, we don’t box ourselves in with fixed-bid projects that often lead to cut corners, inferior software, and mobile/web development that carries inflated costs with underwhelming performance. Zibtek works carefully with each client to set a realistic budget in the planning phase, and we deliver fully-fledged solutions that meet or exceed all of your development needs on an evolving basis. We make your offshore team a responsive, accountable, and communicative part of your organization for as long as you need them, without the expense when you don’t.\nWant to discuss your project and see how Zibtek can help?

If you just look at the typical rates charged by outsourced developers in India and other tech-savvy yet lower-wage countries, you’re ignoring all of the potential problems that could arise and inflate your offshore development costs.\nKnowing how to hire offshore software developers—and knowing how to manage them once they’ve been hired—takes no small amount of experience, cultural knowledge, and management skill. If you want to see real cost benefits from your software outsourcing, you have to dig beyond the price itself.\nA Straight Price Comparison is Just the Beginning of Offshore Understanding\nSince we know you’re curious, and since it will give us a good baseline to work with, we’ll go ahead and take a look at typical software developer rates here in the US versus the average hourly rate for a software developer in India.\nFor Ruby-on-Rails developers in the US, answers to this Quora post seem to suggest that $100/hr is a fair market rate—perhaps slightly on the high end, but not by much (and it’s a nice number to work with, so we’re going to run with it). Different programming languages, experience levels, additional benefits, and whether a developer is salaried or hourly (and an employee vs. a contractor) can all affect development costs, of course, but $100/hr is a decent estimate for a US-based software developer.\nIn India, meanwhile, there’s some consensus that the average listed rate for a Ruby developer is around the $20/hr range. But don’t get excited! According to everyone who answered the Quora question, what looks like an 80% discount almost always bought substandard work. Project delays, communication issues leading to wasted work and added hours, poor quality output, and more. Offshore software developers charging $20/hr may be common, but it doesn’t mean they’re up to par.\nFor a top-notch developer in India, you’re probably looking at doubling that rate to $40/hr or so, and you still need to figure in the additional costs for management, communication, and some leeway for wasted time. Working with a developer from another country, with a different schedule and a different culture, simply isn’t the same as managing an in-house developer or even a US-based remote contractor. The sense of accountability and ownership is frequently lacking on both sides of the outsourced developer relationship, and that means cost overruns that quickly eliminate any cost benefits to outsourcing.\nGetting the Best of Both Worlds: Offshore Development with Accountable Management\nA US-based project manager with experience handling an offshore team—ideally, with experience handling the specific offshore team working on your project—is the best way to pursue outsourced software development. Hiring an offshore developer is easy, but it won’t get you the results you want with the savings you’re looking for.\nHire the team, and work with a lead who speaks your language (literally and figuratively). You’ll be much more pleased with the budget and the outcome than a project completed with a low hourly wage alone.\nAt Zibtek, we offer custom software solutions for businesses of all sizes. Our digital strategy, design, and custom software development solutions have helped a wide range of clients to meet their goals—ask for a free consultation to find out whether we can do the same for your business.

    "extractedText": "OFFSHORE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT\nOvercoming Communication Barriers With Your Offshore Software Development Team\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n18 APR 2018 • 3 MIN READ\nPerhaps the most common concern when using an offshore software development teams is overcoming communication challenges. While communication is key, misunderstanding can happen among local employees too. Regardless of the location of your employees, building rapport is highly important for overall successful communication. On-site employees have the benefit of being able to develop a rapport with coworkers at the water cooler. That rapport proves useful when things don’t go smoothly. But how do you develop a rapport with someone you’ve only met over Skype? It comes down to effective communication. Communication is effective when it’s clear, complete, and mutually understood.\nTransparency is key in working with offshore software development teams. Aren’t you irritated when you receive an email in the middle of the week asking for several deliverables from you, all due by Friday? Me too. It’s annoying, hard to comprehend, and almost always takes back and forth correspondence to sort out what the email sender is actually looking for. Try to mitigate this issue by being clear and focused in your communication. Rather than emailing tasks left and right, utilize a ticketing system and focus on one topic per task. Chances are you’ll write a more concise, clear request and you’ll get a better and faster response. If you need more than one thing from a person (you always do) create separate tasks with due dates. As always, another set of eyes never hurts, nor does a second read through and spell check.\nAnother key ingredient in effective correspondence is using language that everyone on the team understands. Even if your team is outsourced, thus speaks another language, use simple language to explain tasks, deliverables, and overall goals. Shy away from slang as it opens the doors for misinterpretation. Most developers will take anything you say very literally, especially if English is not their first language. Saying, “Our app is in the wild” could be very confusing to someone who doesn’t understand that you’re actually just saying the app has been released to the general public.\nMake sure you’re giving developers complete instructions. Meaning that task-based correspondence should give the necessary details a developer will need to complete the task you’re requesting. This does not mean that clarifications won’t need to be made down the road. There is a happy medium that exists between enough and too many details. That happy medium is hard to zero in on. You need to give your team enough info to get the output you want, but not so much detail that you leave nothing up to the developer or designer. Developers do this for a living, chances are that most developers have come up with a thing or two that you’ve not thought of or maybe even just forgot.\nBecause your offshore team may come from a different cultural background than you or your onsite team, it’s important to be understanding of their culture’s rules of conduct and behavior. Here are a few rules to live by for overcoming communication barriers with your offshore team:\nTake time to learn a little about the culture you are engaging with.\nMinimize delays by adjusting project lifecycles.\nUtilize communication channels that will support speaking i.e. follow up a phone call with emailed notes, action items or highlights.\nIt’s helpful to have a team lead that is responsible for making sure that both teams feel understood and progress is being made. Offshore software developers that are in the know should provide a team lead for each client’s project. Zibtek goes the extra mile and provides a team lead based in the US as well as an international tech lead. These team members are in constant communication to make sure that your project is firing on all cylinders. We’ve got proof that this model works! When resolving issues that hopefully don’t, but may arise, remember to ask open-ended questions and never to respond to issues via email or chat.\nYou know that old saying, “I’m responsible for what I say not what you understand.” Well, unfortunately, that old saying does not apply when outsourcing software development. But if you live by this motto then you probably don’t work with people anyway… Take our tips for overcoming communication barriers for a whirl during your next offshore software development project. We promise they’ll help you increase your offshore team’s productivity, reduce the risk of engagement failure, and provide you with a great product.\nContact us to learn more about how we do offshore software development the right way.

    "extractedText": "BUSINESS\nThe Most Underrated Quality Of A CEO\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n26 SEP 2018 • 3 MIN READ\nIt’s easy to find information about how a CEO should act in the early stage of a business. It is equally essential for you as a CEO to understand how to make the most of your growing company. There are a lot of misperceptions about what makes a truly great CEO, as evidenced by the fact that some of the most important qualities of a CEO are underrated by most people.\nAs the CEO of a company, you might love doing many tasks yourself. Though it might seem noble, it is not the right thing to do. You should focus on doing things that only you can do. If you think that there is someone in the office who can manage any other task, it is wise to allow them to do the job.\nIt is not a good idea to spend most of your quality time on things that can be quickly done by others. As a CEO, the most underrated quality you should have is the ability to let go of things and properly delegate.\n1. You Can’t Run a Company Alone\nSince yours is a growing company, you need to understand that you will not be able to do things all by yourself. Even if you can use all 24 hours in the day, you will still fall short. You might need help to offload some of your responsibilities. Understand the fact the getting significant deals take some time. It might seem like hiring requires you to spend too much time interviewing people, but once you’ve hired good people your job will be much more manageable.\nIt is common for the entrepreneur CEOs to feel that they can do everything by themselves. But, if you want to become the best CEO, it is crucial for you to know that you cannot do everything. You need to hire people who can share your responsibility. As you delegate your core tasks to others, you can free yourselves from activities that are not of priority. You may then shift your attention to things that are of priority.\n2. Find People Who Are Smarter Than You\nIt is critical to the success of your business for you to surround yourself with people who can understand your vision and assist you in achieving your company’s goals and objectives. Most importantly, it is vital for you to find people who are smarter and are experts in their fields. They can bring a lot of value to the things that you intend to do.\nFind top-notch engineers who have subject knowledge and hire salespeople who know how to get deals in the pipeline. The people whom you intend to hire should have vast experience in that particular field and should have the knowledge and expertise to do things according to industry best practices.\n3. Set the Vision\nAs the CEO of a company, you need to create a vision for your company first before planning to bring the people onboard. After which you need to take care in hiring people who understand and adapt your vision as their own. They should be able to see your vision and know what you are going to build.\nYou should give them enough training so that they are on the same page as you. By doing this, you can let them do things independently with the assurance that they are working toward the shared goal. But it is only possible when each of the employees in your entity knows and understands the vision of your company well.\n4. Trust and Defer\nIt is essential for you to follow the principle of ‘trust and defer.’ After hiring critical people on the team, you need to take time to help them understand your vision and the goals you want to achieve as a company. Once you educate them about these things, you need to delegate specific responsibilities to them. Once you entrust them with a responsibility, it is essential for you to allow them to make any decision in that particular area freely.\nYou will be surprised to see that people do a fantastic job when you entrust them with specific responsibilities. They will also attain domain expertise when you designate an area for them. A good CEO conveys confidence to the people that he or she hired. This positivity and respect can have huge benefits for the business’s outcomes.\n5. It Will Hurt You\nIf you have had a hand in many company tasks from its founding, as the company grows it can be a surprise that more employees are sharing your duties. While in the beginning, there might be only one or two co-founders, suddenly, you will realize that there are more than ten people across the globe working for you.\nAs long as the employees are trustworthy and smarter than you, understand your vision and have expertise in their field, you are on the right track. It’s easy to think that you should be involved in the day-to-day operations of your business, and, of course, you will be to some extent. But you can’t get stuck in the details. As a CEO, you should work on setting the vision and focus on things that only you can do. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

    "extractedText": "BUSINESS\nQuestions To Ask Yourself Before Raising Money\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n18 SEP 2018 • 4 MIN READ\nRaising money is one of the ways startups can find success. They get the necessary support to accelerate their growth in the market and can trounce the competition. The catch, however, is that funding often entails giving away a part of your company’s ownership to others.\nSome startups raise the money for reasons that are unnecessary for growth. It is essential for you to evaluate your needs properly before raising money. Self-evaluation is sometimes the best thing to do if you want to avoid making foolish mistakes that will cost you a lot.\nHere are some great questions to ask yourself before planning to raise money for your startup.\nQuestion No 1: Why Are You Planning to Raise the Money?\nIt is essential for you to understand and answer this question first. Are you doing it for the prestige? Is there a real business need? Some people fundraise because they want to follow the trend and say, ” Everyone is doing it.” Some do it to get the expertise by having VC’s (venture capitalists) who have experience on their board. This is a good thing to consider, but it comes with significant risk as you are giving away a considerable portion of equity to them.\nVC’s get almost 25% of the company which is a lot. Instead, you can choose to hire people who have the experience to be on your board, and by giving them a small share, you can still benefit from their experience. Don’t make the mistake of raising money for the wrong reasons as you might end up regretting. The best reasons why you need to plan on raising the money is because you have found a solution to a critical problem and you need enough money to execute it.\nOne more reason why you may consider this option is that you have a growing base of paying customers. Raising money in a situation like this is nothing but a matter of scale. It allows you to do things that you otherwise could not. You will be able to hire more employees or launch the product a little earlier.\nQuestion No 2: Are You Confident That You Understand Your Audience Well?\nAt the core of every business is the critical element of providing a solution to a crucial problem. And this solution is not for everyone but a specific audience or customer base.\nFor example, Facebook wants to connect people who want to build their network and stay connected with people they love. In the same manner, Tesla creates high-end, sophisticated electric cars for affluent people who care about the environment.\nIf you lack a proper understanding of your audience or customer base, you will not be able to build a sustainable business, period. While you might make some sporadic money, you will soon suffer from the “feast and famine” model of entrepreneurship. Raising money is not going to change the needs of your target customers.\nIt does not matter if you have $0 or $ 500,000 in your bank account unless you can provide a solution to a problem that a group of people is suffering and are willing pay you for.\nQuestion No 3: What Are You Planning to do With the Money that You Are Going to Raise?\nDo you have plans to hire people, buy equipment and inventory or hire contractors that can build your website or mobile application? The moment you begin to hire people, you are increasing the stakes. There should be a way to bring in the extra revenue to pay for your salary and the salaries of others. Buying equipment like top-of-the-line cameras or building a video studio is going to be of no benefit if you or your employees do not know how to use them.\nYou should also take the time to think about ways you can maintain this equipment if you run out of the investment money. Having money is excellent as it can help you accomplish so many things within a short period. But what are you going to do once you finish spending the entire amount? It is sometimes wise to keep business simple and expand it over the years.\nQuestion No 4: What Are Your Options?\nAre you going to become bankrupt or do you have to find a day job if you do not raise the money? Or are you going to put in hard work and effort to find a better solution to the problem that people are encountering?\nSometimes, raising money can seem like an easier option than improving your core product. This is a mistake. You are not going to achieve anything if you have zero customers and a million dollars in the bank. Never raise money to avoid hard work which is the foundation that is required to build the business.\nQuestion No 5: Are You Building the Business to Sell It?\nThis is one more thing that you may need to ask yourself. If you have no plans to sell your business soon, you need to avoid things that will take you to that path. Most of the investors are interested only when you plan to grow and sell the business so that they can make a return on their equity investment.\nSometimes raising money can be a great way to grow your startup and benefit from industry expertise. However, it is not without downsides, and you have to consider these before taking the leap. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

    "extractedText": "BUSINESS\nHow To Build A Lasting Culture In Your Startup\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n14 SEP 2018 • 3 MIN READ\nMost people have heard about the innovative work culture that Apple and Google have built over the past few years in Silicon Valley and other parts of the world where they have offices. Since every organization is different from others, the culture that you build will be different from others. According to the Oxford Dictionary, culture means “the customs and beliefs, art, a way of life and social organization of a particular country or group.”\nWhen it comes to your workspace, the culture you experience in the office is the everyday reality of organizational life. You are wrong if you think it is the mission statement or a balance sheet or the handbook for employees.\nMany things fall into this category. Things that we say and do, the way we behave and the way we treat each other are all part of the culture. Even stuff like our products, customer communities and the staff, including yourself, fall under this bracket.\nAs business owners and founders of startups, it is essential for you to build a strong, lasting, organizational structure that can help the employees become your best ambassadors.\nHere are five simple methods you can employ to achieve a strong and last company culture:\n1: Begin With a Purpose\nIn the initial phase of a company, things look simple and straightforward. Communicating with others and the problems that you face tend to be simple. It is true especially when the headcount of the company is still in a single digit. Things such as communication and decision-making become more complicated when you grow and become significant. In fact, communication becomes more sporadic during this phase.\nIf you want to avoid this kind of situation, it is essential for you to lay down a clear purpose when you establish the company. But for you to create the purpose, it is necessary for you to understand the “why” for the operation.\nAlso, know what or whom your business is going to serve. Let your answer be as authentic, inspirational and aspirational as possible. Companies like Apple, Amazon, and Ikea have a strong purpose. It sets them apart from others and their competitors. It is time to think about things that inspire you and execute them.\n2: Take Time to Define Values, Common Language and Standards\nIf you desire to build a culture that will succeed, it is essential for everyone in the office speak the same language. From the CEO to the mailroom worker, everyone needs to understand the core values. You can make your culture tangible by creating a common set of values, principles, and standards.\nCohesiveness is only possible when you can align the culture, language and the standards. Never forget the fact that cohesiveness is the end goal of building a culture. Though you might employ some stop-gaps along the way, it should only be a short-term solution.\nFor the culture to last for a long time, it is necessary for you to make some adaptations along the way as the company keeps growing. Remember, the core values that your company has should be your constant staples. It is also necessary for your overall culture to be malleable to acclimate to different employees and times that keep changing.\n3: Leaders Set An Example\nThe culture of the company usually is shaped by the way the leader acts. It is, therefore, essential for you as a leader to reflect the company’s culture both internally and externally. As a leader, it is critical for you to be the strongest advocates of the company’s core values.\nYou as a leader can inspire your employees when you have an incredible passion for the things that you do and if you have an exemplary work ethic. Being radically transparent is a real mark of a great leader. Even though your company has a great culture, if you cannot show it through your own actions, your employees will not believe you.\n4: Treat People Right\nIt is essential for you to treat the people well. Some people might have some excellent skills but a bad attitude. Hiring this kind of person is not good for your organization as they can soon sabotage the culture you have built.\nInstead, it is necessary for you to hire people who have a great attitude and give them opportunities to grow along the way. Therefore, it is essential for you to screen people for their character in addition to their skills.\n5: Identify Your Cultural Ambassadors\nEvery company has some employees who love, live, eat and breathe your culture. It is vital for you to recognize them in the group. They are your biggest advocates, mainly because they love your company and are willing to support its cause.\nThese employees are your most valuable assets. Once you find them, interview them to find out what they like and dislike about the current culture. It will help you gauge your culture well. You can then make the necessary changes to keep your most loyal employees satisfied. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

    "extractedText": "Is .NET Dead? | Why The Bay Area Is Still Using .NET\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n18 APR 2018 • 5 MIN READ\nIs .NET Dead? | What is .NET?\nIs .NET Dead? To start off, WTF is .NET? .NET is a programming framework used to build web and mobile applications, created by Microsoft. Developers use frameworks to call in code without having to actually write it. Frameworks like .NET are typically used as a way to access web services, databases, and communication tools. Pretty useful, I’d say. With the insurgence of new technology coming out of Silicon Valley, some have argued that the .NET framework is old news. On the other hand, the world is full of .NET proponents who have high hopes for the framework’s future. We’ll cover the opinions of both sides and give you our take on why the bay area is still using .NET.\nIs .NET Dying? | Why Some Say It Is\nFrom the mouth of the dev world’s master, Jonathan Oliver, “Why did I leave .NET? In short, it constrained our ability to choose (which is a huge deal for me) and turned our focus inward toward the perceived safety of the nest instead of the helping us experience all of the possibilities out there in the big, wide world.”\nSo is .NET dying? .NET certainly has a stigma around it. That sigma could be due to some developers distaste for Microsoft in general. Many felt that the technology became irrelevant as more and more open source alternatives have come available. Microsoft became privy to this and now offers the full server stack in open source.\nSo what is .NET for? From a whole business perspective rather than a developer’s perspective, using a Windows framework has the potential to narrow the market for app installs as predominantly Windows users will install the app. There are also added costs such as using SQL server, loyalties to Windows, and upgrades.\nAn Oldie but a Goodie\nIn the land of ever-changing, and always evolving technology, it’s hard to believe that .NET would still be relevant. It’s kind of a dinosaur in the tech world has been around for more than 15 minutes. Nonetheless, .NET is nothing if not relevant in Silicon Valley and abroad.\nAs previously mentioned, the entire .NET server stack is now open source. This includes ASP.NET, the .NET compiler, the .NET Core Runtime, Framework, and Libraries. This allows developers to build using .NET across not just Windows but also on Mac or Linux. Since the insurgence of .NET to the open source world, apps can now be developed on any OS using Microsoft’s new open source code editor, Visual Studio Code.\n.NET is a totally scalable and powerful solution. .NET functions using Managed Code which provides plenty of tolerance out of the box. When your application is executed, it is assembled into native executable code, managed by the CLR. This means that the CLR allows some certainty of your application’s function, benefiting its security and capacity.\nIs .NET Dead?\nIs .NET Dead? No. Because of .NET’s wide range of functionality, it was (and still is) quite popular. Some companies have the budget to completely update old products in new languages but many companies don’t. Any company with a smaller budget will tell you, maintaining a framework is much easier and less costly than implementing a new one. Bay Area companies are looking to companies like Zibtek to maintain their core products so they can focus on new development. This also gives Bay Area tech companies the ability to add new features without taking senior-level employees to focus off of the business as a whole.\nFinally, .NET’s brainchild, C# is a big deal. Like anything, people can find reasons to love it or to hate it but the bottom line is that it’s runtime efficient, scalable, and easy to maintain. C# was designed with practical objectives in mind and works seamlessly with the .NET framework.\nWhat is .NET For?\nWhile it’s anything but new, .NET is still a totally viable option for web and mobile development, which is why so many San Fran developers are still using it. Testing out new, trendy technology is great, and as a company of developers, we love to learn new technology but what’s trendy doesn’t trump what’s reliable. The .NET community is growing faster than ever, especially since the technology is now open source, and it’s laden with experienced .NET developers.\nThe future of .NET is .NETreplace Core\nWith the writing on the wall stating more or less that no one was interested in paying licensing fees to use a programming language, Microsoft shifted strategies. Microsoft lost the battle for supremacy to open-source alternatives in Python, Node, and Java.\nThe company has largely made open-source most large parts of the software, including the C# language. In 2016 Microsoft released the first version of .NET Core, and it is poised to replace legacy .NET.\nThe growth of .Net Core over time\nASP.Net Core makes use of a web server, Kestrel, allowing programmers to hose an application on Linux or MAC servers as easily as Windows servers. The .Net Core platform also facilitates development on macOS, Linux, or Windows.\n.NET Core also provides:\nInbuild support for Angular and React JS making web development easy, modular and feature rich.\nDependency injection, reducing hard-coded dependencies among classes.\nOne final consideration\nMany legacy applications are written in older versions of .Net. For many firms, it makes far more sense to migrate their application to .Net Core as much of the syntax is similar making re-training existing team members on the technology much easier than switching to a whole new platform.\nFrom a cost and timeline perspective, many firms are able to realize the benefits of an ASP.Net Core migration rather than a full re-write of their software.\nSoftware Development at its finest!\nDownload our Software Development Playbook to get in the know on what works.\nAt Zibtek, we offer custom software solutions for businesses of all sizes.

    "extractedText": "BUSINESS\nThe Best Way to Get Users to Review Your App\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n13 DEC 2018 • 4 MIN READ\nIf you look at some of the most popular apps, almost all of them have tons of five-star reviews. It makes sense because one of the most powerful ways to attract new customers is great reviews. You don’t have to launch something and just wait and see if you get killer reviews. There are strategies to get reviews that every startup should know. In a nutshell, these are the principles you should follow:\nBuild an app that is great\nQuit irritating your users\nRequest them nicely, never beg for the rating\nThe reason why top apps get good reviews and ratings is that their focus first is on building an app that provides a user experience that is of high quality. Now, to achieve this, it is essential for all the team members to give their full attention and commitment to the project. Secondly, they followed some simple rules when they have to get the reviews from the users, and it greatly helped them in their success.\nHow Important Is the App Ratings?\nWithout a doubt, the ratings that you receive on the app will affect the way people discover an app. Depending on the reviews and ratings that you receive, the results can be positive or negative.\n1. The ratings that an app receives on an app store determines its position on the search results as well as chart rankings. If an app gets so many ratings, especially positive ones, the chances are high that it will fair well in the search results. There are fewer chances for the app to fluctuate in the top ranking charts. As a result, it will hold its position well for a longer time.\n2. If you got too many positive ratings on the app, it is a good thing. The app that you developed has good chances of ranking high in the search results.\n3. Most of the users hesitate to install any app that has a 3.5 rating or lower on their mobile device. The reason is quite apparent. People do not want to have a poor experience by installing an app that does not seem right.\nAs a result of the things mentioned above, it is necessary for you to seek ratings from the users. Ratings then play a crucial role in getting your app discovered. The number of downloads increases drastically when your app has got some good ratings. It is necessary for you to not beg for ratings as it might be one thing that can irritate the users. Many people despise it.\nShun Pop-Ups Most app developers place a pop up on the screen that interrupts the user experience. The pop up contains a request to give the rating now or wait until some later time before doing it. These are some simple yet powerful rules that you need to follow when you are requesting reviews:1. Never interrupt the user experience. 2. Never ask for the rating right after the app crashes. This is obviously a terrible way to get five-star reviews.3. It is better to delay in asking for the rating until at a time in the future. You want the users to give you constructive feedback. You will learn more about it in the later part of this article.\nWhen to Ask?\nThere are several possible strategies. As one example, a hotel booking app asks the users to share their rating only if the person made a successful room booking. Since the user might have had a good experience, they ask them to share their thoughts. If a person never completed a booking, there is no point in you asking them for a rating.\nThe path that many other apps chose is entirely different from the app cited above. Since many apps do not provide transactional experience to the user, their approach to asking for a rating is different. They send requests only to the users that visited the app more than ten times within the first three days of downloading the app.\nNow, if you think about it, they are not focusing on a large crowd, but a smaller group of people who might be more motivated to leave a positive review.\nBy using this simple rule, and of course, by using the popup, many of these apps were able to get incredible ratings.\nThe Poor Ratings\nIt can come as a surprise to many app developers when they are getting a poor rating because they were asking customers to rate the app. Many people did mention that the reason they are rating down the app is that they find the pop up quite irritating. It is interrupting the experience they are having in the app. A pop up requires the user to interact with it. In response to this feedback, development teams have found better ways to handle requests for ratings.\nIntegrated the Rating Requests\nOne solution that a development team came up with is quite outstanding. To resolve this issue, they incorporated the request to rate within the app. Now, they placed this request between content items on the app. This allows the users to do what they like. If interested, they can click the request and provide the rating. But, if they are in no mood, they can skip it.\nAsk Appropriate Questions\nMany popular apps are doing a fabulous job when it comes to getting ratings from the users. In the traditional method, companies are taught to beg for reviews. But the staff at many startups were smart enough to place a question to check if the users are enjoying the experience they are having with the app. If people respond in the affirmative, they are taking their feedback. Even if the users are unhappy with their experience, they are seeking feedback.\nThe main reason why they feel it is crucial for them to take feedback from people who are not satisfied as well is that they know that they are loyal users. These users are using the app more than ten times in less than three days after downloading the app.\nThey know that the feedback that they will provide is going to be critical for them to consider. It can help the team to look at the flaws and try to enhance the user experience. It is quite interesting to note that people who are not having a good experience are not being asked to share a rating.\nIn Conclusion\nIf you want to get some good ratings, following these methods is not enough. You have to focus on enhancing the quality of experience that people are having on the app. Undoubtedly, if you have an app that is of poor quality, you will get poor ratings. The secret to getting a 5-star rating is to build an app that gives users a great experience. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

To maintain a central repository of communications and insights into customer satisfaction, requirements, and buying habits, enterprises are adopting Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems and marketing automation solutions. These solutions help marketing teams find new customers faster and boost their lead volumes. And these systems help the sales team’s productivity and ability to close deals by making insights across the data readily available.\nThese tools are beneficial not just for large enterprises. Small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) often think they don’t need these tools until they expand their businesses. But, the truth is, these tools provide the same value to enterprises as SMBs. The right CRM and marketing automation tool can boost productivity for SMBs and set them on a path to major growth. The best tools are scalable and offer automated customer interactions, real-time analytics, fraud detection and more.\nWhile CRM and marketing automation technology seem to be the same thing, they actually serve two distinct purposes. You should understand the difference between these tools in order to choose the best solution or combination of solutions for your business. Choosing a wrong system (that doesn’t go with your business needs) can hamper your business process or potentially cost you money. To help introduce you to the world of CRM, we have listed detailed information about the key items to consider when choosing a robust customer management solution for your business.\nWhat is customer relationship management?\nCustomer Relationship Management (CRM) is a tool that businesses use to connect more effectively with their customers and potential customers. It helps organizations strengthen customer relations, improve business performance and increase sales and profitability.\nUsing CRM, the following business functions can benefit:\nSales teams: Sales teams use CRM to understand their customers better and to gain a high-level perspective on their operations and see how sales campaigns and products are performing in the marketplace. Using CRM, a sales manager can track the performance of individual team members relative to predefined sales targets. The advent of powerful sales automation tools can help automate repetitive tasks performed by the sales team, enabling them to become more productive. Instead of spending a huge amount of their time inputting data, they can focus on selling products and services for the company.\nMarketing teams: CRM with marketing automation components allow marketing teams to capture lead data and can get a clear picture of lead responses and other market opportunities. They can understand the customers’ likes and dislikes about specific products and services and help reduce the amount of time it takes to get powerful market information in the hands of sales teams.\nCustomer service teams: Using CRM, the customer service team can track customer conversations (including feedback, issues raised, etc.) on various channels (Facebook, Twitter, etc.). CRM provides a common platform for customer interactions, reducing the chances of unsatisfactory responses or miscommunications. This, in turn, prevents the company from losing their valued customers.\nSupply chain teams: With CRM, the entire supply chain can be managed effectively. Supply chain teams can track meetings with partners and suppliers, add notes, schedule follow-ups and more.\nHuman Resource (HR) teams: HR teams can leverage CRM tools to automate the tasks of scheduling and managing candidates, accelerate their onboarding process, analyze and track resource needs and more.\nGrowth of CRM\nAccording to numerous surveys, since the end of 2018, CRM adoption has accelerated year over year. By 2025, the industry as a whole has projected revenues of over $80 billion.\n(image source: superoffice.com)\nWhy CRM matters?\nIf you are planning to expand your business, you need a proper business strategy (including sales targets, business objectives, and profitability goals) to execute your plan well. However you look at it, the future is unpredictable and getting reliable and up to date information on your business progress can be difficult and time-consuming but incredibly valuable. This is why you need a CRM system. With CRM, you can analyze and understand your target audience, the present state of the market, your competitors, past and present growth and your all-important sales pipeline. These data points are critical components of the decision-making process and can facilitate better decisions for the future expansion of your business.\nIncreases sales efficiency: CRM enables you to increase sales by handling customer interactions more effectively and prioritizing leads that are most likely to convert into sales.\nCRM provides you complete and accurate information about customers and prospects.\nHence, the sales team can focus their attention on the right clients, gaining a competitive edge in the marketplace.\nRetaining your customers: Suppose an important salesperson leaves the company, how do you make sure you don’t lose the data tied to their accounts and effort put into that customer account. A company without a CRM would have to worry about the loss of information surrounding historical interactions with the associated salesperson customers. Using CRM technology, other members of the sales team can have access to the complete history of the customer. Any member of the sales team can quickly answer questions, jump into the account, and provide for customers the personalized solutions necessary to retain them.\nIncreasing upsell opportunities: CRM enables the salesperson to understand customer preferences for products and services, purchase history and more. The value of this data can’t be overstated and will help the organization make business-related decisions, boosting sales at the same time.\nWhat is marketing automation?\nMarketing automation is a tool used by many Businesses to strengthen and maximize marketing efficiency, improve overall campaign management and nurture and generate leads.\nHow marketing automation tool helps marketers?\nBest for nurturing leads: With marketing automation, you can keep your customers engaged by giving information about the company’s offerings (products and services) and establish trust with them. This, in turn, helps you to maintain a long-lasting relationship with your potential buyers.\nAll-inclusive campaign management: Using marketing automation, you can get key insights into your potential customer’s behavior. This will help you to make smart marketing decisions.\nAutomate numerous marketing tasks: The primary goal of a marketing automation tool is to automate the complex manual process of marketing tasks and simplify decisions with data. Blog management, social media distribution, email marketing, email workflows, web to lead capture and contact database management are key elements of marketing automation.\nDifference between CRM and Marketing automation\nThe end goal of CRM and marketing automation tools are to transform raw leads into qualified leads, convert those leads into sales and increase business profitability. There are some key differences between these two systems that are important to understand.\nMarketing automation CRM\nMarketing automation is primarily a marketing-focused tool. It is used to create brand awareness and engage users who have expressed interest in the products or services of your organization.\nCRM is a sales-focused tool. It is primarily used to manage clients and leads that have been handed over by the marketing team (with the help of marketing automation tools) to the sales team.\nHere is a quick use case - take, for example, using marketing automation tools, the marketing team has generated leads. One of those leads has requested a product demo. The marketing team passes that lead to a salesperson. Using the CRM system, a salesperson can email or call the lead to schedule demo. It will track all the communication between the lead at every stage of the funnel and with the salesperson. This will help the salesperson to analyze the needs of the customer. After the demo, on the basis of customer interaction, the salesperson can decide whether to qualify or disqualify the lead or to close the deal. The marketing team can similarly view the data to make better decisions about who to market to and how with the customer sales interaction data at their fingertips.\n(Image source: Capptera.com)\nIntegrating marketing automation with a CRM system\nIn any organization, the marketing and sales department need to work closely and share common goals. While marketing people create brand awareness on a larger scale, the salespeople have the ability to approach the customers and sell the products in an unmatched personalized fashion. For all businesses (large, small, enterprise), sales and marketing alignment is critical. The growing combination of marketing automation and CRM software is driving increased competition fueling the necessity for the business to adopt these tools. The value of CRM is creating its own necessity with increased adoption, further increasing competition.\nBenefits of including marketing automation in CRM:\nConsistent communication between the sales and marketing team. For instance, using a single unit (CRM with marketing automation), the marketing team can effectively engage the leads in new ways by delivering the right message to the right person at the right time. This will help them to drive more qualified leads to sales. Then, the salesperson can prioritize the leads and close the deals.\nSales and marketing teams will get actionable insights into every aspect of the process, making the process transparent. Hence, both the teams will be well aware of the criteria for qualified leads.\nSteps to determine the right CRM and marketing automation tool\nDefine your goals and functional requirements\nFirstly, it is important to understand your business goals. While deciding which CRM system or marketing automation tool will fulfill your business objectives, it is essential to identify your business needs first. To analyze the exact business needs, you should conduct a meeting with internal stakeholders and also with the employees who are going to be using the CRM or marketing automation tools. As every business is unique, you should look for a CRM system that will fit your business requirements.\nIf you are planning to scale your business, then it is an undeniable fact that your business requirements will change in the future. In order to address your business problems and requirements, going for a customized CRM can be a good option for your organization. Although ready-made CRMs or marketing automation tools can also serve the business purpose for SMBs. However, sometimes it can be costly as their additional subscription fees per feature and upgrade costs can be expensive.\n2. Evaluate the options (cloud-based or on-premises)\nBased on your business requirements, you have to choose between cloud CRM and on-premise CRM. The market appears to be marching towards cloud solutions. Before deciding between these two, you need to weigh their pros and cons. While many CRM companies provide cloud-based CRM systems, there are some people who hesitate to move their company’s data to the cloud because of security issues. In the end, only you have to decide whether you are comfortable with your data residing in the cloud or if you need an on-premise CRM system; between the two options, the actual feature set will likely not vary.\nAnswering the following questions will help you to choose between cloud CRM or on-premises CRM:\nIs your business is growing? If yes, then how frequently you need customization and upgrades of a CRM system?\nDo you have enough manpower or infrastructure in order to implement on-premises CRM?\nWhat are your security concerns while going for cloud-based CRM?\nWhat will be a cost-effective approach for your growing business in the long-run, the cost of building customized CRM or buying ready-made CRM?\nOnce you have figured out and answered these questions, and compare your answers against what is available in the market, you will have a clear idea of whether you need to buy a CRM or build one.\n3. Select the right CRM or marketing automation tool\nIn order to get maximum ROI, choosing the right CRM or marketing automation tool is essential. From a plethora of options being available in the market, 360+ by our measure, it can often be overwhelming to decide which one to choose. To help you with this, here are a few tips to choose a CRM system:\nMake a list of potential vendors who are offering the product. Talk to them and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of every product, keeping your budget in mind.\nAnalyze the vendors by asking the product (or service) demos. Also, inquire about training and support services so that your employees can use the tools seamlessly.\nAsk them about future integration capabilities of applications like social media, e-commerce, databases and more. Because as your business grows, you will likely need enhancements in the CRM or marketing automation tool.\nAt Zibtek, we understand your business needs.

The thereNow technology is used to more effectively see teachers and students in action. By creating this solution, thereNow has changed the way the education industry has approached Professional Learning and observational research. Using this technology, teachers are now able to receive discreet, classroom contextualized coaching and feedback that has evaded the majority of Professional Learning initiatives.\nChallenge\nthereNow was looking for an out of the box hardware/software solution to integrate with its existing online platform. The search was not successful, creating a need for a custom solution. Finding the right talent to build this solution was important, as the company had tried several different options, none of which were a fit. thereNow began to worry that it would miss out on a new market opportunity because of the difficulty in finding the right talent. thereNow initially worked with several freelance developers who did not deliver workable results and who were expensive to contract. The company also tried to hire internally for this particular skillset but could not find a suitable engineer. Finally, they found an offshore software developer who fit the bill. Enter Zibtek.\nGoals\nThe overarching goal of this project was to create a hardware solution that integrates with thereNow’s existing online platform. Having had lackluster experience with freelancers in the past, it was important to get this project completed in a timely manner and within the budget. The solution was built in just five months.\nSolution\nZibtek worked with thereNow’s CTO and Product Owner to build this robust custom software solution. Because of the complex nature of this product, thereNow really appreciated having a US-based tech lead whom they were able to communicate with daily. The thereNow product offers two cameras. One camera to record the instructor and another to record the student’s reactions to his or her lessons. These recordings are combined, audio is added in, and the video is sent to the online platform where it can be reviewed and instructor feedback can be given.\nOutcome\nBecause of thereNow’s new solution, it was able to ship over 200 boxes of product to current customers. The company has also been able to increase its offerings and improve its services for existing customers. thereNow’s competitive advantage has totally changed as thereNow is the only provider in the education market offering this custom hardware with two cameras. With this solution, thereNow can offer additional benefits to its customers that they can’t get anywhere else. The result is more effective instructors with more successful teaching methods.

It gives you scalable, budget-friendly deliverables on a timetable that’s second to none. Done wrong, outsourcing sucks. It gives you incompatible components that cost too much at any price on indefinite schedules that can stretch on months beyond their useful life. Bridging the cultural gap is a big part of successful outsourcing efforts. It helps clarify goals and deadlines, establishes roles and responsibilities in a way everyone understands and appreciates, and it sidesteps a host of communication and logistical issues that are easily overlooked by those who don’t have the outsourcing know-how. Most importantly, it keeps our offshore team focused, on task, and motivated to deliver their best work without being micromanaged.\nHierarchy Matters More in Many Non-US Cultures\nThe US strives to be a classless society. I’m not even going to dip a toe into the deep and troubled waters of that statement, but in general, we hold at least the superficial principle that everyone is equal: that no specific job, position, lineage, etc., entitles anyone to more or less respect than anyone else. The CEO (or their assistant) has to wait in line at Starbucks like anyone else.\nIn many countries popular for their high-skill, lower-cost workforce—especially India and other countries in Southeast Asia—hierarchy and social class are far more prominent and important than they are in the US. Moral and value judgments of this cultural feature are immaterial from a business perspective; class structures are deeply ingrained in these cultures, and you can either work with that fact to create more intrinsically rewarding jobs and opportunities for your outsourced team, or you can try to implement a more “flat” organizational structure that won’t be fully adopted and that will lead to inordinate levels of frustration for all concerned.\nThe choice is pretty simple. In cultures where hierarchy matters, climbing the rungs of the social ladder is a HUGE motivating factor, and an essential component of long-term job satisfaction. Whereas US workers tend to find their workplaces more friendly and rewarding when there’s less stratification, workers in some other cultures prefer the endless layers of middle-management that give them a very clear and well-defined place in the business hierarchy. Creating clear hierarchies in your outsourced team’s working environments and relationships gives them clear opportunities for advancement, which can greatly reduce attrition and turnover and help you retain top-talent over multiple project lifecycles. You get better output without spending excess time seeking out the right personnel time and time again, and your team feels greater satisfaction and earns greater respect through their long-term advancement. It’s a pretty clear win-win.\nZibtek Fosters Long-Term Outsourcing Relationships\nOur cultural understanding is part of what’s enabled us to continue working with some of the best offshore developers, programmers and engineers for years. Our offshore relationships are clear, well-defined, and happily productive for all concerned, allowing us to continue building them with each new project rather than starting from a new foundation every time.

The basis of his point in starting with why is that understanding why a business functions the way it does is not based on profits but on the emotional reason for existence. Sinek argues that people don’t buy what businesses make, they instead buy why the business makes it. The what and the how are important factors too, but follow the why in Sinek’s Golden Circle.\nWe’ve spelled out the why in our last post, Why San Francisco Software Companies Outsource. It boils down to getting the best talent globally available to develop the best products at a lesser cost. This continuously improves the quality of tech products being built, motivating developers to build better and better products. Now that you know why, you may also want to know what Silicon Valley is outsourcing.\nAs Silicon Valley outsourcers have embraced globalization of software development, this has expanded the possibilities for what can be outsourced. When offshoring was new to the US, many thought to outsource non-skilled jobs, such as manufacturing. Now, the market has changed and many countries, like India, have highly skilled workers fully capable of building your core product.\nWhat Companies Can Outsource\nWhat Silicon Valley outsourcers are choosing to subcontract is largely dependent on the size of the company. The number of in-house employees and the skillsets of those employees are often what urges tech companies in San Francisco and abroad to outsource. Here is what SF tech companies are outsourcing now:\nPhoto by Austin Distel / Unsplash\nStartup Scene:Everything. Ok, not everything but quite a bit of core product development goes overseas as this is often the largest expense for a new company. For some companies this is an MVP (minimum viable product) and for others it’s a full fledged native or hybrid app. The big draw towards offshore development for startups is cost savings. Typically, startups don’t have the cash flow needed to support full time W2 employees for each project they want to work on—that applies to both the company’s product development and their client’s.\nSmall to Medium Business Brigade:The SMB’s of Silicon Valley are looking to offshoring where their in-house skillsets are lacking. While SMB’s have more predictable cash flow than startups, many still experience fluctuations. Those fluctuations make it hard to justify hiring a Senior Developer for just a short period of time.\nPhoto by Austin Distel / Unsplash\nCorporate Clique: Big companies outsource too! From extra QA to code and test coverage, even tech giants don’t want to waste time on menial tasks. Silicon Valley tech companies are among the most competitive workforce in the world. Because the market is saturated with companies trying to hire the best San Fran has to offer, it’s hard to keep good employees from being swept away for bigger salaries and better on-the-job perks. Outsourcing expands the talent pool from just Silicon Valley to all developers. By utilizing outsourcing practices, these tech companies can hire the best of the best.\nSimon would be proud. We started with why San Francisco software companies outsource, then we filled in the what with options for every company size. Now all that’s left is the how. We’ve got some opinions (and a pretty strong bias) about how to outsource successfully and can help. Reach out.\nAt Zibtek, we offer custom software solutions for businesses of all sizes.

    "extractedText": "WEB DEVELOPMENT\nThe Best Way to Outsource Web Development in 2021\nVedant Vyas\nRead more posts by this author.\nVEDANT VYAS\n27 FEB 2021 • 6 MIN READ\nMany businesses tend to overlook web development when they’re starting. It’s a mistake that they can’t afford to make. With the internet now a major driving factor behind the success of businesses, it’s clear that those who invest in their web presence have a much higher chance of achieving success.\nWeb development might seem like a herculean task to those who are not familiar with the process. Many business owners are unaware of the process through which they can have a web presence built for their business, let alone be proficient in the technical side of the process.\nAs daunting as that may seem, there’s no shortage of resources available for them that explain exactly why they need to be investing in a web presence and how they can do it. The easiest way forward is to outsource development work to a third-party.\nWhat is Outsourcing Web Development?\nOutsourcing has changed the way the industry works. It has enabled businesses to access a vast talent pool as and when needed. They don’t need to hire highly skilled resources and thus place the company under immense financial stress.\nThink about it. If you’re the kind of business that only requires a single-page website without any subsequent feature additions or even updates, it would make absolutely no sense to have a full-time software developer on the payroll.\nSo what would you do in this instance? You’ll outsource the job to a third-party developer. They’ll understand the requirements of the job and create that single-page website for you. Once that’s done, they’ll take the agreed upon payment and be on their way. You get a website, they get paid. It’s as simple as that.\nThat’s a very simple example of what outsource web development is conventionally like. Outsourcing isn’t just limited to simple tasks. Many organizations outsource major projects because it helps them rapidly scale up. Different methods to outsource web development.\nIn a nutshell, contracting the work out to a third-party is basically what outsource development entails.\nHow to Outsource Web Development in 2021\nYou’ve decided to outsource web development for your business, now what? How do you go about finding the right partner that will be able to bring your vision to reality?\nOutsourcing doesn’t necessarily mean that the entire project will be handled from start to finish by a third-party. For example, you could do all of the graphics work for the website yourself and leave the development work to the contractor. You’ll need to find a balance that works for you.\nMany businesses, particularly startups, prefer outsourcing the entire project to a third-party. This service provider will have developers, designers, and other specialists on its team. A project manager will provide oversight and will also report to you, the project owner, about the status of the work.\nOnce you’ve decided whether you want to outsource the entire project or parts of it, then it’s just a matter of finding the right development partner. That can often be easier said than done.\nAsk for their portfolio\nIf you’ve come across a software developer that seems to be promising, always ask them for their portfolio. This will give you a great idea of their competency and skills. Developers who are vying for your business will have no concerns in showing you their body of work.\nReview the portfolio to see if they have worked with clients in your industry before. This means that they have a level of insight that can be beneficial for your project as well. If the developers are listed on a social platform, you can also check their reviews to see what other clients have said about their work.\nSet expectations\nYou need to lay down for the developer exactly what you expect to get out of the work they’ll do. This also helps them do a better job since they will have clarity on the requirements of the project.\nClear communication is key to setting expectations. Once you’re upfront about the details of the job, the developer can then inform you how much the project will cost you and when they’ll be able to deliver the work. It’s better to sort these details out first before embarking on the project to ensure that everything works smoothly.\nGet regular updates\nThere’s a degree of diligence required on your part even when you outsource development to a third-party. In most cases, they will have a project manager who will follow up with updates regarding the projects.\nThat’s a great way to stay in the loop. Keep an eye on what the developers are doing and if there’s anything that needs to be changed, they can be informed ahead of time. Even if the company you chose doesn’t assign a dedicated project manager, you can always be proactive and reach out for regular updates on the status of the project yourself.\nMistakes to avoid when Outsourcing Website Development\nGetting attracted by offshore savings\nA critical mistake that many businesses make is that they get attracted to the savings that an offshore development firm can provide. It becomes quite difficult to sort out genuine companies from the less desirable ones when they’re located in another part of the world.\nCommunication can always be difficult in such situations and your options for dispute resolution may be limited due to them being in a different jurisdiction. Offshore developers may be able to do the work for cheaper but there may remain a question mark on the quality of their work.\nNot being clear about the project budget\nBefore outsourcing any development work, have a clear idea of how much budget is available for the project. The developers won’t be able to work effectively if they don’t know the budget.\nIt needs to be communicated to them at the very beginning of the project so that they can adjust what needs to be done accordingly. Discuss the needs of the project and the available budget with them. They will be able to provide guidance that may even help you get what you’re looking for under budget!\nRushing through the selection process\nSelecting the right development partner to outsource work takes time. Their skills and experience need to be weighed against the nature of the project and the budget available for it.\nIt’s never the right idea to go with the first development firm that puts in a proposal for your project. Consider multiple options, rank them against each other, obtain quotes and see which one best suits the criteria that you’ve set for the project.\nNot communicating enough\nThe project owner is responsible as well to maintain an open line of communication. The partner that you’ve outsourced work to may have questions from time to time and they would need answers to them fairly quickly.\nThey shouldn’t have to wait for the answers for too long. As they will most likely pause work on the project until they have received a definitive answer from the client. Any delay in communication from your side is only going to result in delays for the completion.\nDon’t forget quality assurance\nQuality assurance is a vital part of any software development project. Both the client and the developer need to ensure that the project has been completed as per the requirements and there exist no issues that could cause problems down the line.\nThat’s why thorough quality assurance testing is carried out when software projects are completed. It prevents the possibility of unknown errors disrupting things in the future. The development partner that you work with should agree to quality assurance testing.\nGet the right platform for your outsourced web development\nBusinesses of all sizes can outsource development. It’s a great way of getting work done quickly and efficiently. Most of all, it’s not as resource intensive as bringing an entire team of software developers onboard can be.\nFinding the right development firm can often be a challenge but once you find one that fits the bill, you’ll likely return to them for future projects as well. That has been Zibtek’s experience with its clients that range from both Fortune 500 companies and startups.\nZibtek has been a software development partner for some of the world’s most leading companies in a variety of industries.

    "extractedText": "BUSINESS\nWhat the Product Death Cycle Is and How to Break Out Of It\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n6 NOV 2018 • 4 MIN READ\nUndoubtedly, the most challenging part of any new product launch is it’s beginning. When you realize that it is not working, you will be spending too much time iterating or molding the experience to fix the issues. It’s good to know all possible scenarios when it comes to product launch ahead of time so you know how to react.\nUnderstanding Product Death Cycle\nDavid Bland, a management consultant from San Francisco tweeted a diagram that explains this whole concept in detail. No wonder they say a picture is worth a thousand words! The figure he posted illustrates this entire process in three circles that are interconnected and form a never-ending cycle. The three circles represent the following actions that we take when a product is not working:\nNo one uses the product.\nCheck with customers to know what features are missing.\nBuild or Develop new features.\nBut, this cycle is never ending unless we put in some efforts to find the core issues and fix them. It is imperative for you to understand each step of this cycle. Understand why this process is repeating even when you make some changes. And then present a list of questions or proposals that will allow you to escape from this cycle.\n1. No One Uses the Product\nNow, this is the natural state of any product in the market that is not being utilized by the user. There is no problem with this in itself. But the way you handle this particular problem can launch you into the product death cycle.\n2. Check With Customers to Know What Features Are Missing\nOne of the biggest mistakes that you can make as a startup is to become user-led when developing a product rather than placing emphasis on product vision. If you are approaching customers with the question, “What are the features that are missing?”, the problems that are in this approach is explained in detail below.\nThings to Ponder\nIt is essential for you to understand the fact that there are so many more non-users of the product that you have than the ones that are using it. So the features that you are going to bring or modify will benefit only the group of individuals that love using your product. Because of this, the features that they are requesting to add may not be the one that will attract a larger customer base.\nThe best way to fix a design problem is by doing user research. But you should not expect the users to come up with their design solutions. You should never forget the fact that it is your job to come up with design solutions. It is possible for users to get stuck in a particular concept or assumptions. And they may not be able to come up with their solutions as they may not have all the necessary tools and skills.\nYou might be utterly wrong if you are assuming that your product did not find success because it does not have an ample amount of features in it. Features are not the main reason why a product fails most of the time. There are countless other reasons that might be affecting your product. The pricing of the product can also make a significant impact. Or it may be because you are not taking care to market it well. Others factors such as broken activation or poor presentation can derail a product launch. The wrong positioning can also adversely affect your product. Take time to research and identify those elements that are causing your product to fail.\nQuestion Yourself\nBefore jumping to the conclusion that something is missing from the product, it is imperative for you to ask yourselves, ‘What are some reasons why users not using a certain product?’ You should not forget we are living in the days when you can lose almost 80% of active users in 30 days. And there are many reasons why you can observe this kind of bounce rate. Analyzing this is essential if you want them to get into deep engagement with features.\n3. Building the Missing Features\nNow, we can term this as the second jump in the product death cycle. Building up the features that customers think are lacking is not a good idea. It is a wrong assumption that more customers would like to buy your product when you add a new feature.\nYou should not forget that, as discussed above, you are going to encounter an amazing drop off after the first interaction of users with your product. Building new features is not going to make an impact on the result either.\nBreaking Out of Cycle\nThe product death cycle is quite a tricky thing. Though the right intentions drive your strategy, you get stuck. Taking the time to listen to customers and building something they need is not the wrong approach. All the people who are in the product death cycle think that they are doing the right things. It’s necessary for you to remember that it takes more than good intentions to get things on track. Questioning numerous times will help you realize the cause behind the lack of growth.\nThings such as marketing, positioning, distribution, content marketing, PR, and pricing can affect the product. Sometimes, building a utilitarian product may be of benefit to your company rather than a network-based product. Always tailor your solution to the root-cause to move toward success instead of getting caught up in added features. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

Nice work! Google, amongst other big tech companies like Amazon and Facebook take the best of the best so even getting to interview is a huge accomplishment. That said, it’s not a walk in the park for even the best engineers… While you may walk into the office super prepped and self actualized, the moment you’re asked to whiteboard with a tenured Google Product Manager you might feel a little different. Just try not to pee you pants, ok?\nYou can expect several rounds of interview regardless of the position you’ve applied for. Big companies like Google and Facebook aren’t going to get to know you in an hour. Wes Bos recounts his experience interviewing with Google a few years ago in this post. Namely what you can expect in your first round of interview is a hefty reading list including all things Comp Sci 101, and skills to brush up on such as sorting algorithms, hash tables, binary trees and the like.\nIn your second round of interview, it’s not uncommon to do some whiteboarding. Be prepared, your interviewer will be watching your every move. Saurya Velagapudi, a senior software engineer at Google says that’s what separates the boys from the men if you will, is the interviewee’s ability to find the best answer to the question being asked. I know how this sounds, just coming up with an answer to some of these grueling questions is impressive, and now they want the best answer? Oh, and don’t forget to also explain why it’s the best answer. Treehouse gives an in-depth example of what you can expect and how to give the best answer.\nTips from Past Interviewees\nPrepare with actual interview questions that previous candidates have been asked. Check out our list below from Interview Cake.\nWhile writing code during your interview be sure to write your code as close to fully complete and correct as possible. interview, write as close as possible to fully complete, correct. No pseudocode.\nReview your code, and for heaven sakes please test it!\nVerbalizing what you’re thinking while problem solving will show your interviewer how you tick.\nYou will need to understand Hash tables, Vectors, and Big O.\nActual Programming Questions you Can Expect from Big Companies:\nFacebook\nAmazon\nGoogle\nMicrosoft\nNow that you’ve seen some of these interview questions can we talk about how awesome Interview Cake is? Seriously, it’s an excellent resource for interview prep regardless of the position you’re interviewing for or the size of your next prospective company. End shameless plug.\nHow to Interview Developers at a Startup\nIn this interview with Jay Acunzo, Saurya Velagapudi, a Senior Software Engineer at Google, gives his take on how to interview software developers for any size company. He says that Google likes to hire generalists rather than specialists, which ironically is how most startups hire, as they need one developer to wear many hats. The reason Google hires in this way is that it wants to be able to end a project or even a whole department at the drop of a hat if it’s not working. That doesn’t mean that Google lets go of the people working on said tanking project, it means that because they are generalists, they can move to a new team and work on a new project. Don’t be mislead by Google’s definition of “generalist.” Google’s idea of a generalist is kind of like running an 800 meter race against an olympic 400 meter hurdler. Though the 800 isn’t their race, chances are they are still a pretty dang good runner… Google’s generalist developers are still pretty much experts just in several languages/technologies.\nAt Google, each interviewer gives specific feedback on the candidate, as well as a general take on whether or not they’d personally hire the candidate, to a hiring committee. This hiring committee is ultimately responsible for making the final hiring decision. Velagapudi says that all companies should consider using a hiring committee and interviewers separately to prevent bias. He also suggests that interviewers create a rubric of take aways for each interview they perform. This way the interviewer leaves having actual concrete evidence of what kind of candidate the interviewee is rather than just leaving with a feeling about them. He says to consider questions for your own rubric such as, What have they accomplished? How could they fit into your team? How do they view the world? He also gives examples of interview questions that he actually asks in every interview he performs.\nSample Questions to Ask Startup Candidates\nHow many lines of code have you written in the past year?\nWhat percent of your time do you spend head-down coding versus managing or scoping product or talking to customers?\nHow many hours in a day do you spend coding?\nWhether you’re hiring for a big company or trying to figure out how to interview software developers for the first time, the best candidates are engineers first and specialists second.

    "extractedText": "PRODUCT MANAGEMENT\nWhat Makes A Good MVP?\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n9 SEP 2018 • 4 MIN READ\nCrafting and publishing a minimum viable product (MVP) gives you a taste of the potential market before you fully commit. Many entrepreneurs think it is an industry best practice to release an MVP before releasing the product with its complete features. But some people are not convinced when it comes to the MVP idea.\nTheir argument is that they not want the customers to use an incomplete and unpolished product. With the bare minimum features that the product has, they assume it is not going to make any impact, and, in fact, they will feel that it is going to hurt the product’s ultimate market performance later in development. These claims are worth examining before jumping on board with the MVP model.\nWhat is the best way to bring a product to market? Should you develop an MVP or hold out for a fully fleshed out product? The answer to these questions boils down to understanding the difference between a good minimum viable product and a bad one.\nUnderstanding the MVP\nUndoubtedly, an MVP is the skeleton of your end goal.It is the foundation on which the rest of the product rests. It has only the capabilities that are required to solve a specific problem that you are planning to target in the market without any of the frills.\nReleasing an MVP is definitely an excellent method to scope out the market that you are planning to enter. Only after seeing a demand for your application, you’ll be willing to invest money for extensive development. Shockingly, almost nine out of the ten startups fail. Almost half of startups fail because they create a product that people don’t want, a mistake that might have been avoided by releasing an MVP.\nSo, in some cases, an MVP helps you to check if there is a need for your product in the market. Based on the reaction of the market, you can decide to develop the complete product. The best part about the MVP is that it will help you to reign in the temptation to include superfluous add-ons. All the features that you make should support the end purpose of meeting the core goal.\nUnderstanding the Argument\nDespite these clear benefits of an MVP, many people think that it is a bad idea to release the MVP because they say it will damage your brand reputation. They presume that you are going to disappoint your potential customers with an unpolished app. Since the product has simple features, it won’t be able to offer potential customers a seamless experience. As a result, the common argument suggests, customers will be turned off by the MVP and reject the product.\nWhile this argument makes some sense, lacking an understanding of what an MVP should accomplish is what fuels this fear. It should not be a shoddy, rough draft product. A good MVP is a prototype of the product in process that tests assumptions and acts as a launchpad for future development.\nWhen you badly complete an MVP, it doesn’t highlight the core feature of your end-product. As a result, you’ll attract customers who likely won’t be interested in the completed product and your market information will consequently be skewed.\nDeconstructing an excellent MVP\nThe interpretation of the words minimum and viable can tell you the difference between a good MVP and one that is lacking. People who worked on a good MVP understand that ‘minimum’ in MVP does not mean a half-hearted attempt at a project with lots of corner-cutting. It is necessary for you to solve the problem in the minimum number of steps required but to do so in a sophisticated way. This is the obvious prerequisite before you call it a product.\nIt is the truth that a product that is ‘minimum’ sometimes fails to be functional. ‘Viability’ means the product is capable of doing what you claim its core function is. That means the product solves an issue and completes a function for the consumer. If a product fails to address an issue or does not respond to an actual market demand, it is not viable. These things indicate the elements that a good MVP needs to have to achieve market success.\nTraits of a Good MVP\nA good MVP is one that is a functional product. It is quite robust and has no fluff. Brands usually fail on an MVP because of neglecting the core goal of the product and because they build a product that is essentially nonfunctional. They think it is okay to create a product in this manner and think they can get some feedback from the customers.\nA true MVP will include legitimate functionality so you can feedback from actual potential customers. Customers won’t reject an MVP that offers a novel tool that addresses a legitimate need in customers’ lives. They are likely to accept a product that works, even if the product is not fully polished.\nResist the temptation to treat an MVP as a rough draft. You have to conduct some market research and also know who your target customers are for the products before beginning the MVP. It’s important to come up with consumer personas and note the customer issues that you are planning to address. Only after doing this thorough research, determine the features that you want to use in the MVP. Again, you’re not making a rough draft but a carefully crafted, minimalist version of your solution.\nWhen you do the MVP poorly, it won’t provide helpful market data or reach potential customers. If you do the MVP well, it can help save time, money and resources which will eventually build your customer base. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

    "extractedText": "Customer Discovery Interview Questions You Can Use to Validate Product Market Fit for Your Startup\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n2 OCT 2018 • 5 MIN READ\nYou can use customer discover interview questions when you are talking with customers in the initial phases of project in order to get a good sense of what they're looking to achieve. This phase of product development is essential. Yes, communication is the most powerful, informative and the cheapest tool. Use it to validate the assumptions of the user segments and their problems. Conducting customer discovery interviews is crucial. You can use it to equip yourself with great insights. These interviews will help you in determining the unique value proposition for the product. You will understand the actual market need better after this session.\nFollowing this, you will have the opportunity to develop ideas or hypothesis which you can test with successive quantitative research. Make sure to utilize the precious time you have with customers to learn the truths they can offer you. The only significant risk that you will encounter during the process is collecting false positives (“it’s an excellent idea”) and false negatives (“this is not going to work”).\nBig players such as Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, and others do customer research before launching their products.\nUsing Customer Discovery Interview Questions to Organize the Meeting\nAsking customer discovery interview questions will make a world of difference in understanding your clients and finding ideal solutions to their problems. When you are planning to meet customers, take enough time to prepare well for the interviews. Know your objectives, write them on the sheet of paper and find the right way to achieve them. The first thing you will need to understand is that you are going to ask them questions to learn more about the problem that they are facing. By being part of this research, they are going to help you come up with a solution. People usually are not just happy but are excited to be part of research that helps others succeed.\nBe kind, courteous and smile throughout the interview. Create an environment that assists the customers to open up about their problems. Remember, that the more comfortable they are in the meeting, the more information you can draw out from them. Ensure that the interaction feels less like an interview and more like a conversation between the friends.\nYour primary goal is to learn a lot about the problem rather than trying to sell your product. Learn more about the new features that they want in the product. Reveal to them only the intention of the meeting and nothing regarding the product. Work with your team on preparing questions that might help you to better understand the problems the customers are facing.\nCustomer Discovery Interview Questions: The Right Ones to Ask\nWhen it comes to customer discovery interview questions, you’ll need to understand the difference between the good and bad ones to ask your customers. There are some questions that you can ask that will help you understand the customer’s problems better. Some questions can contribute to collecting false positives and false negatives. Here is a list of the questions that you may choose to ask or avoid:\nTip 1: At Least One Question to Check the Potential of Your Idea\nNot many people will truly grapple with this idea. And, it is crucial for you to know if the product will really work. But, there is no point in wasting time developing a product that has no market need. If there is a flaw in the idea, it is wise to realize it sooner than later.\nTip 2: Avoid the Following Questions\nDo you believe it is a good Idea?\nAre you willing to purchase this product?\nWhat is the amount you are willing to pay for this product?\nAre you okay to pay $x for the product that has this particular feature?\nThese are some questions that you for sure need to avoid as they are not good. Since we are not presenting the core idea to the customer, it does not make any sense why we should seek their opinion. Even if the customers say he will buy the product, it does not mean they will for sure do it. Mainly as it is just an opinion about the future and not a behavior that has occurred in the past. You should realize that a comment like this is a big fat false positive.\nTip 3: Questions You Should Ask\nHow did you learn about the product? By posing this question, you are trying to understanding the customer acquisition mechanisms that are working well for the company. You will also know if the customer acquisition mechanisms are consistent with the perception of the company.\nWhat is the process you picked to choose this product over the competition? By asking this question, you are going to learn more about their sales process and most prominently the key stakeholders and the ultimate decision-makers for buying your product. This question will assist you in clearly understanding their sales cycle length.\nWhat is the reason you choose this product? You are now digging into the product differentiation. The best way to identify different customers segments that are in the market who might pick a different product to meet their needs.\nWho are the teams that use this product in your company? Did this change over a period of time? This inquiry will reveal a lot about the principal users, the growth potential of the product and negative churn if possible.\nHow important is this product when you compare with other software? As per Paul Graham, this is a hair on fire problem. If your product does not end up in the five most essential needs, the sales cycle will lag mainly because no internal champion will promote the product.\nHow much are you paying for the product? Do you find it worth more or less than X product? This inquiry will assist you in ascertaining if the customer feels that he is getting a return on investment wildly in his favor. You are also checking to identify if the company is doing everything possible to match the price point with their branding.\nIs the product evolving quickly? Are you content with the customer support and working with the company? These questions show churn risk. Customers will be happier when they receive excellent customer service and fast evolving products. They feel that the startups care about them and do everything possible to delight them. It is one of the best diagnostic tools that can expose overselling of the product. You will also understand if the sales team is overpromising to attain quota. This action will lead to customer disappointment for the product.\nTo whom are you planning to recommend this product? This inquiry will assist you to understand the breadth of the potential customers that you can get for your product. You will also know if the existing customer has the vigor to promote the product. It is a qualitative proxy for the market size.\nIn conclusion, all of these questions are customer and product discovery questions. They are identical to the ones that product managers use to know if the company has product-market-fit. In addition, the interviews that you do will help you surface insights about the current market positioning of the product. You will understand the true perception in the market, the effectiveness of customer support, overselling and the product importance. You should also realize the fact that the potential investors will use the same data to evaluate your product in the future. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

We provide so much more than a traditional vendor to our clients; we’re truly invested in helping every company that contacts us succeed with their development goals and stake their claim as a trusted and effective brand.\nHow to Grow Without a CTO\nSome personnel changes left Molio with a key knowledge gap and some management hurdles they needed to overcome. All this came at a crucial point in their platform development. With deadlines fast approaching, it was a dire situation for the company. They still needed to hire a development team, but none of the executives in the small startup had the technical expertise needed to determine which team.\nEven if the right team could be assembled, there was no one in the company to lead the development charge and bring the platform to market.\nInstead of trying to find a CTO and bring them up to speed, which would have meant more delays and massive costs without any guarantee it would put Molio back on track, they contacted Zibtek. We offered software development services and CTO-level advice, not simply providing the engineering necessary for a minimum viable product but helping to guide the company’s technical operations to fit strategic goals and investor-backed milestones.\nMolio gained access to a senior development team that had a long history of working well with each other and the expertise of a US-based project manager to ensure accountability, responsiveness and appropriate goal-setting.\nThe end result? Not only was Molio able to stick to their original timelines despite their personnel interruption, but, with the help of Zibtek, they exceeded expectations and completed several deliverables ahead of schedule. Other items were brought forward in their growth and development plant, and those were successfully met, too.\nEveryone involved was tickled pink, and Molio’s investors were more than pleased to be backing the brand.\nZibtek helped Molio move on from a truly scary place—one where the ax could fall on the whole operation at almost any time—to a successful launch and continued growth. And all through the affordable, ethical, and effective magic of outsourcing done right.\nHow Can Zibtek Help You?\nNot every company finds itself in such a bind as Molio, but emergency moments are an all-too-regular part of the development process. Have a story you’d like to share? Tell us all about it in the comments! Have a problem and wondering how we can assist? Drop us a line and we’ll dive right in!\nWe have the development team, the management experience and the strategic knowledge you need, and we’re always looking for our next great partner.\nThis is clear from our work with Molio. As one-stop-shop for video marketing, from content creation through optimization and advertising, this startup had amazing value to offer, but technical holdups were keeping them from market releases. Here’s a little story about how Zibtek helped Molio’s expertise shine—while generating some handy revenue, too. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

    "extractedText": "DevOps Explained\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n1 MAR 2019 • 9 MIN READ\nWhy would you want DevOps explained? Many large enterprises and organizations that are web-native are accelerating their efforts to adopt DevOps into their firms. But as these efforts are getting underway, many people still do not understand the true meaning of the term DevOps. The question that people have is if it is an approach, a culture, a philosophy, a movement or if it is merely a blend of all these various aspects. Many people think that it is understood differently by different people.\nDevOps Explained\nNo matter how you are going to define DevOps, to achieve a DevOps success, you need to cover a lot of ground. Here are some answers to the most fundamental questions that you might be having:\nHow do you define DevOps?\nWhere exactly did it originate from?\nWhat issues have led to DevOps?\nHow exactly does DevOps function?\nHow widely are people using DevOps these days?\nWhat is the main reason why your peers are choosing DevOps?\nWhat are some of the key benefits you get by using it?\nHow do you define DevOps?\nDefinition of DevOps\nSo if you'd like DevOps explained then we'll get more into it about the definition of DevOps. Patrick Debois is one of the first persons to coin the term “DevOps” way back in 2009. He is considered to be one of the gurus to teach about this subject. You get this term by combining two words, “development” and “operations.” Now, we start to realize the true meaning of this particular word. In a nutshell, it is not a technology, a process or a standard.\nIt is a fact that many people who devote themselves to this system call it a culture. Most of the experts in the industry favor this idea. “DevOps” movement is something we use to refer to subjects such as future trends and adoption rates. And “DevOps Environment” refers to an IT organization that has embraced the DevOps culture.\nWhat is the most accurate definition of DevOps?\nWhat is the most accurate definition of DevOps? Here is an excellent definition of DevOps from Gartner: “DevOps represents a change in IT culture, focusing on rapid IT service delivery through the adoption of agile, lean practices in the context of a system-oriented approach. DevOps emphasizes people (and culture) and seeks to improve collaboration between operations and development teams. DevOps implementations utilize technology— especially automation tools that can leverage an increasingly programmable and dynamic infrastructure from a life cycle perspective.”\nWhat Exactly Is Devops?\nWhere Exactly Did It Originate?\nThough there are several different accounts you can find about how DevOps originated, not all of them have the truth. It is not an idea that they weaved out of a single thought. Several different IT experts hailing from different disciplines were instrumental in developing this thing. They planted tiny seeds of DevOps before it formally took the present name and form.\nESM or Enterprise System Management: Most people who were involved in creating the definition of DevOps, in the beginning, were system administrators. They were instrumental in bringing the best practices of the ESM to DevOps. It includes things such as toolchain approach, system monitoring, configuration management, and automated provisioning.\nAgile Development: You can interpret DevOps as nothing but an outgrowth of gile or agile software development. It directs close collaboration between developers, customers, QA and product managers. It is encouraged mainly to fill in the gaps, as well as iterate rapidly to create a better product, provide better service delivery and so forth. Value proposition as understood by a customer means the way the systems and app interact with each other. DevOps, therefore, is concerned with extending the principles of Agile beyond the coding to the complete delivered service.\nWhat issues have led to DevOps?\nIt is a known fact that system administrators and developers do not look at things with the same eye. On the one hand, customers tend to pull them in an entirely different direction and on the other hand, business users might be demanding change concerning new services, features and revenue streams much more quickly. It is true that they might expect systems that are not only stable but those that are free from interruptions and outages.\nIt can cause some serious problems as a company can end up in confusion not knowing what they should prioritize. They might be wondering if they should focus on delivering the changes swiftly or focus on dealing with the production environment that is quite unstable or focus primarily on the environment that is stale and stable. None of these choices is acceptable to the executive enterprises. And none of them permits a business to give the customers the best solution.\nDevelopers know how to make and push the software forward as they have expertise in that particular field. Operations teams are well aware that rapid changes are quite harmful when there are no proper safeguards. Besides destabilizing a system, it can go completely against the charter.\nBy using DevOps, you can overcome this dilemma by integrating deployment and software development. It includes everyone from business users to developers and from test engineers to system administrators. You can create a single workflow that is highly-automated with an increased shared focus. It enables you to deliver software that is of high-quality while at the same time maintaining both the stability and the integrity of the entire system.\nThey can achieve this as they embrace some common principles that not only transcends above the traditional discipline roles and boundaries.\nHow exactly does DevOps function?\nLike any other culture that you find out in the world, DevOps has many variations. But some capabilities are quite common among all the cultures. Collaboration, continuous integration, automation, rapid remediating, continuous delivery, testing, and monitoring are some things that are the most common among all.\nCollaboration: It is good to work as one single team instead of blaming each other. There is a disconnect between the operations team (IT) and developers. DevOps focuses on uniting the efforts of both of these departments as well as other departments such as testing, product management, and others in the team. Having collaboration across the various units is good for the organization.\nAutomation: DevOps requires you to use a lot of tools to automate most of the process. While you can buy some tools, there are some which you need to build. Fortunately, so many open sources tools are available these days. Using these tools, DevOps automates large portions of software development as well as the deployment process.\nContinuous Integration: One of the fundamental principles of an Agile approach is to integrate things continuously. It is one of the primary or critical reasons why you can see continuous integration even in DevOps as it emerged from an Agile culture. Developers need to integrate their work with the work of other developers at least once in a day. It is the only way developers can work on the issues that arise because of the integration. In the waterfall development method, you can identify the problems later. But, in DevOps, you can find them in an early stage.\nContinuous Testing: When it comes to DevOps, the quality of the coding should be kept in mind when the developers are creating something. They cannot expect the QA team to check the issues and report. It is the responsibility of all the teams. When it comes to the QA teams, they need to do their job much faster than taking weeks and days to identify the problems.\nThey have to use automation tools to identify the issues ASAP. Besides automation, they can do it more quickly because they redefine some of the testing methodologies.\nContinuous Delivery: By adopting the DevOps model, software development companies are automatically building, testing and preparing their product for a release through production. It is fascinating to note that large companies are using DevOps to achieve multiple deployments easily in a single day. The medium performers can push an update weekly or monthly.\nContinuous Monitoring: Since there are going to be a great number of releases in a delivery shop that is continuous, continuous rather than intermittent monitoring is necessary. The waterfall development model uses pre-release testing. But, in DevOps, you do not have that much time. It is, therefore, quite essential to fix the errors in real-time. A team can easily measure the availability and performance of software to increase the stability.\nWhen you are monitoring continuously, you can identify the causes of an issue immediately. Monitoring like the testing starts during the development phase. Because of which you can use the same tools that you use to monitor a production environment to identify performance-related problems even before they hit production. The two types of monitoring that you need in DevOps is as follows: application performance monitoring and server monitoring.\nHow widely are people are using DevOps these days?\nIt is an interesting question. The answer is that early startups to enterprises that have 100 years of legacy are embracing the DevOps model. It is making significant inroads with prominent IT organizations almost everywhere in the world. According to a survey, almost 74% of the companies that participated in the study admitted that they use this model.\nThe immediate next question that you might have is what kind of companies are embracing this particular model. Amazon, Facebook, Netflix are some of the internet giants that have adopted it. Barclays Bank, Sony Pictures, and USG are some other prominent companies that have a great name in the industries that they serve also embraced this model.\nSo many companies across the globe understand the value that comes from using this particular model.\nWhat is the Main Reason Why Most of Your Peers are Choosing DevOps?\nDevOps has so much to offer to everyone that is in the software chain. Developers, testing and operations teams can reap the benefits of using this particular model.\nDevelopers: Programmers love the automated provisioning that DevOps offers. With zero paperwork and no lengthy approval cycles, a developer can easily stand up a software development environment. It completely changes the way they work. They can become innovative and creative quickly. Developers quickly learn of the things that happen in the operations team. One can solve the problems much faster when the DevOps model is in full effect.\nOperations: One of the biggest worries that a system administrator has is the stability of the system. A software release that takes down the entire system in just a few seconds of production deployment is something that they would not like. When there is an increase in the involvement of developers, it grows the system stability.\nThe best thing about this particular model is the fact that the automation can quickly eradicate the errors that are caused by humans. It removes the need for spending so much time in doing the same repetitive tasks.\nTest Engineers: The impact that is caused by DevOps on testing is quite enormous. It requires the testing teams to innovate to find new methods to do the testing. By automating the provisioning, test engineers can quickly provision a test environment that is quite identical to the production environment. It enables testing that is more accurate. They can predict the performance of a new release a lot better. Finally, it helps to increase the productivity of the test engineers thanks to collaboration and automation.\nWhat are some of the key benefits you get by using it?\nThe kind of results that you will get using the DevOps model might vary from others that are using the similar method in the industry. It is, therefore, not right to compare yourself with others. According to some of the research, high-performers of DevOps tend to release software almost 200 times more frequently than the low performers. That is approximately 2555 times faster. The quality of the software product is a lot higher as well. IT professionals that embrace DevOps are becoming huge fans of this model.\nStability: Since high-performing organizations are spending almost 22% less time on rework as well as unplanned work, they are now able to spend nearly 29% more time towards the new work like creating new code or building new features.\nSecurity: It is fascinating to see that high performers are spending almost 50 percent less time in remediating issues that are related to security than the low performers.\nDeployment Speed of App: High performers can deploy numerous times in a day when you compare with low performers that deploy only once or twice in a month or in six months.\nIn Conclusion\nIt is essential for you to note that DevOps is something that has come to stay and all for the right reasons. Many thought that it is an impossible feat, but DevOps has been quite successful in integrating developers, business users, security engineers, test engineers, system administrators and so forth. All of them work towards meeting the requirements laid out by the customers. Developers and system administrators no longer argue with each other but support one another.\nBusiness managers will be quite content as they get the software product that they desire. Executives will love watching dashboard metrics such as customer satisfaction, revenue, system reliability – driving steadily towards the north. By choosing this particular model, you are heading in the right direction. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

    "extractedText": "HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY\nWhat is Quality Assurance in Healthcare?\nIan J.H Reynolds\nExplore Ian J.H Reynolds' expertise in finance and economics through his insightful articles on market trends, investment strategies, and economic analysis.\nMore posts by Ian J.H Reynolds.\nIAN J.H REYNOLDS\n20 APR 2020 • 6 MIN READ\nMost people may not associate quality assurance with healthcare. It's widely perceived to be related to manufacturing, the work that quality inspectors do when products are rolling off the production line in front of them.\nThat's actually better described as quality control since that task is product oriented. Quality assurance is related to the requirements and goals for a service. Since healthcare is a service, it stands to benefit immensely from meticulous measurement of key metrics for the improvement of processes.\nQuality assurance in healthcare encompasses the activities and series of measures that are designed to ensure continuous improvement in the quality of medical care. Custom software solutions play a big part in this, since they automate tracking of metrics which can be analyzed to identify problems with care delivery. Quality assurance in healthcare is a vital component of the industry.\nSuch programs not only improve the clinical outcomes but also help increase staff engagement. Team members have actionable data to base their input on so a collective effort can be undertaken to improve the organization's overall standing.\nThere are several factors that influence the quality of patient care. The importance of delivering quality patient care is intertwined with the economic success of a healthcare organization. The improvement efforts may include internal audits, independent performance audits, consumer reports, outcomes analysis, and customer satisfaction surveys.\nHere are some ways healthcare maintains quality assurance:\nIn the United States, quality assurance in healthcare is a means to track the effectiveness of the medical organizations that provide it. The organizations' performance is constantly measured to ensure a high quality of healthcare.\nThe inability to provide meaningful clinical statistics is rapidly being tied to lower reimbursement levels. That's why healthcare organizations are investing resources into robust quality assurance processes. This allows them to meet patient expectations and also figure out what changes need to be made in order to improve the quality of healthcare for patients and their level of satisfaction.\nThere are two major nonprofit groups that track quality assurance in healthcare, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations and the National Committee for Quality Assurance. Healthcare organizations seek these accreditations to quantify their quality assurance for the public.\nThe Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations\nThe JCAHO accreditation is recognized by a majority of state governments in the United States as a pre-condition for receiving Medicaid and Medicare reimbursements. The nonprofit organization accredits more than 22,000 healthcare organizations and programs in the United States.\nA major component of its accreditation process is the unannounced full survey in which the healthcare organization is not informed in advance of its survey date. All member organizations go through a three-year accreditation cycle and while they survey findings are not publicly revealed, the accreditation decision is made public. Any and all standards that were cited for improvement are revealed as well.\nAfter the survey, healthcare organizations that are found to be in compliance of all or most of the standards receive the decision of Accreditation. The organizations have to be in compliance of the standards at least four months before the initial survey and have to remain in compliance during the entire accreditation period.\nNCQA accreditation\nThe National Committee for Quality Assurance provides voluntary accreditation for both medical organizations and health plans. More than 70 percent of Americans with health insurance happen to be in plans accredited by the NCQA.\nIts Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set evaluation system relies on a set of performance measures to track quality assurance. The NCQA designed it to give consumers the ability to compare the performance of different health plans in light of regional or national benchmarks.\nIt measures six primary domains of care which include:\nEffectiveness of Care\nAccess/Availability of Care\nExperience of Care\nUtilization and Relative Resource Use\nHealth Plan Descriptive Information\nMeasures Collected Using Electronic Clinical Data Systems\nQuality assurance software makes a huge difference in healthcare.\nThe use of quality assurance software in healthcare can go a long way in reducing the number of mistakes that can be caused by human factors. It also makes it easier to identify the processes that need to be improved in order to raise the overall quality of patient care.\nIt can help make the lives of both patients and staff easier and safer. That being said, quality assurance programs also require rigorous security testing. Medical data is highly confidential and any vulnerability left unchecked is a disaster waiting to happen.\nHealthcare organizations that deploy such software also need to make sure that it works flawlessly. Any mistake can put patients' lives at risk. Rigorous software testing helps reduce technical errors and keeps the possibility of system failures at bay.\nAnother crucial aspect of a quality assurance program is to figure out the root cause of errors and then coming up with protocols to reduce and prevent them. Quality assurance software can be deployed in both internal and patient-facing systems to figure out where improvements need to be made.\nTesting internal systems for healthcare facilities\nMost healthcare facilities tend to have multiple departments and it's vital for all of the interconnected IT systems to work flawlessly. A single fault at any point can deal a fatal blow to the entire infrastructure and with human lives on the line, that's an outcome best avoided.\nThe quality assurance process should thus involve thorough testing of the software to ensure that it works on all platforms that are deployed in the organization. Digital patient record systems need to be put through rigorous security testing to ensure that no vulnerabilities exist that could be exploited to obtain access to confidential patient records.\nYou also need to conduct recovery testing on medical record systems so that in the event of a system failure, the medical records are not lost. This is a great way of figuring out how the system handles very data-intensive tasks and how long it may take for it to recover if it breaks down.\nTest patient-facing systems\nMost patients prefer tracking their treatment and this can be made possible through patient-facing portals that allow them to view their medication history as well all of their medical records with that organization. The portal can also be used for viewing and paying medical bills in addition to making new appointments.\nAnother crucial component of the patient-facing system is remote patient monitoring. It can leverage the Internet of Things technology to enable patients with serious chronic conditions to easily measure their blood pressure and sugar levels.\nThe feedback loop in custom quality assurance software can be utilized to find out what patients think about the portal. Whether they feel it's easy enough to understand and use or if they feel that the portal is too complicated to understand. Enhanced usability testing of the portal will uncover areas where improvements can be made so that the portal becomes more user-friendly and visually appealing.\nBuild custom quality assurance software for your healthcare organization.\nIt's vital for healthcare organizations to have custom quality assurance software in place so as to constantly improve the quality of patient care. Such a program won't yield any results if the staff doesn't interact with the system or adapt their performance based on the information found in the reports.\nKeeping a close eye on the performance indicators will help the management and staff ensure that their quality assurance program produces the desired results and that the benchmarks are met. Corrective strategies can then be implemented which may include better staff training, equipment updates, infrastructure changes, and more.\nA hospital quality assurance software helps respond to problems in a clinical environment. It's developed to overcome these problems through compliance with the best practices in patient care. Software for the healthcare industry is widely considered to be safety-critical and is subject to higher control procedures than general purpose software.\nGiven the highly sensitive nature of medical data, it’s vital that your custom quality assurance software is developed by a trustworthy vendor. Any mishandling of patient data could put your entire organization at risk so it’s always best to go with a trusted vendor.\nHealthcare organizations are increasingly at risk of being targeted with ransomware attacks. So it’s more important than ever to have software in place that has been rigorously tested for vulnerabilities.\nThe team at Zibtek is highly experienced with building custom quality assurance software for healthcare organizations. It’s based in the United States, with a truly global network of specialists that are all managed from the US.\nIts expert test engineers strive to ensure that all deliverables meet the most rigid quality standards.

    "extractedText": "CMS\nHeadless CMS\nIan J.H Reynolds\nExplore Ian J.H Reynolds' expertise in finance and economics through his insightful articles on market trends, investment strategies, and economic analysis.\nMore posts by Ian J.H Reynolds.\nIAN J.H REYNOLDS\n4 OCT 2019 • 4 MIN READ\nIs Headless CMS a Good Fit for Your Business?\nFirst, a confession: Zibtek used WordPress for a number of our pages on our main marketing site for a long time (too long, as it turns out). My marketing team has recently seen the light and just switched to a headless CMS system after a gentle push from me.\nRe-thinking CMS\nWordPress had its advantages, and there is a reason we, like many businesses, stuck with it as long as we did. A basic CMS system, like Wordpress or Joomla, allows marketing teams to deploy their content from a single location easily and quickly. These CMS systems have all the images, code, and templates the team might need. But traditional CMS systems were built for a website-only era. They served their purpose and served it well, but their time is past (at least until they catch up).\nTimes have changed; well, mostly formats have changed for data consumption. And competition for the delivery of timed and targeted content has grown more appreciably than most firms will be able to adapt to in a short period of time.\nContent published on the web needs to fit a variety of formats out of the gate and increasingly mold to screen sizes beyond the monitor or laptop display. Mobile phones, tablets, TVs, and headsets, all of varying sizes, allow content to be more quickly accessed. A new breed of CMS is required and, recently, has come about. Headless CMS systems allow for content delivery through any channel.\nHeadless CMS systems deliver content via an API, making content consumable on any channel and on any device. This means that your ‘website’ is truly written for any application, web, mobile or anything in between, and thus people who wish to consume it may leverage any tool or programming language and it will be presented in their desired format. The advantages of universally digestible information are the primary benefit and can’t be overstated.\nAdvantages of headless CMS\nThe benefits extend well beyond distribution and into the performance realm. Headless CMS systems are much more scalable and likely more secure than predecessors. API layers are fully decoupled from the CMS and allow different components of the architecture to leverage the benefits of the cloud.\nFor web applications coupled with their blogs, for example – where flexibility is needed for an application’s development and marketing teams-- a headless CMS allows teams to independently deploy changes and stay away from the heft of unnecessary features. The CMS can be decoupled from the front-end and APIs are used to make calls. This allows much faster deployment of marketing content without interfering with what your application development teams may be doing.\nFor our purposes, we’ve chosen an open-source option. We found that the flexibility of matching content delivery networks, hosting providers and our own blend of special code worked best for our needs. Those needs were, first and foremost, blazing-fast performance for our content.\nThe immediate benefits for our switch to a headless CMS were material. Below are two screenshots of the same pages and the same content. The only difference is the headless CMS that we implemented.\nWith a headless CMS: WOW – Much faster!\nIt doesn’t take a tech wizard to see that the performance difference is material in the eyes of Google and likely the thousands of people who read our blog.\nWho is headless CMS for?\nThat answer depends on the person asking the question and their objectives.A large percentage of the internet is made of WordPress instances. Before I go any further, I should state that you can do a headless WordPress instance and it is free to use as it is also open-source.\nFor very small business, the extra work required to maintain a headless CMS over a WordPress instance is probably more than they should be taking on. The automatic updates and ease-of-use outweigh the benefits for most small businesses that are not as readily focused or have a need for top-of-the-line speed or quality.\nBut for those looking to truly compete the headless options available on the market are truly exceptional, if not the best option on the market. Any mid-sized businesses that want to compete needs to have the fastest, most secure and least number of publisher dependencies.\nUse cases for headless CMS\nAs we’ve discussed, headless CMS may be overkill for your website or it might be a great fit for competing in the competitive digital space. Here are a few scenarios in which headless CMS offers unparalleled advantages:\nPublishing on several different channels: when your content is going to mobile, website, print and/or an app, you need content to format correctly in many different media. Headless CMS offers the versatility to accommodate all these different channels with identical content.\nUsing a static site: Static sites are increasing in popularity due to their speed, security, and scalability. Headless CMS is a good fit for a static site, which does not rely on a database.\nAggregating content from multiple sources: Using several sources for content on your website can be managed through a headless CMS for seamless aggregation.\nAs more businesses adopt what’s called a Create Once Publish Everywhere (COPE), or the newest iteration the Create Anywhere Publish Everywhere (CAPE) strategy, headless CMS offers the ability to publish content in a wide range of platforms without technical issues.\nDrawbacks of headless CMS\nWhile the benefits of headless CMS are many and the possibilities may be a good fit for your business as it was for ours, there are technical challenges to consider before making a determination. Developers need extensive front-end experience with multiple codebases to handle the format. Because you can’t always get a preview of how your content will appear, your developers need to have front-end experience to anticipate potential challenges with delivery to various platforms.\nIf you’re still not sure if headless CMS is right for you, this website is a peerless resource guide for those looking to explore options available on the marketplace.

ERP tools are defined as integrated information systems that serve all departments within an enterprise.\nWith such a wide scope of functionality, each ERP system inevitably has its own set of pros and cons. To better understand which is best for you, it is convenient to group ERP tools into four classes: generalist, industry-specific, small business, and open source. The last class, open source ERP software, is often overlooked. However, it can solve three of the biggest problems that crop up in ERP implementation: cost, control, and customization.\nImplementing such a powerful and comprehensive tool can be difficult, and it often requires tweaks. Customization is so popular that 88 percent of companies in 2016 customized their implementation. However, that affects budget: 65 percent of ERP implementations go over budget due to the need for modifications. Customizing a proprietary solution is expensive! That is why more IT departments are looking at open source ERP. Basing an enterprise-wide solution on open source software provides easier customization along with control and cost savings.\nIn this article, we will review what ERP software is, what open source means, the advantages of combining the two, and how to get started with this powerful business solution.\nWhat is an ERSystem?\nEnterprise resource planning tools grew out of software that manufacturing firms used to plan their production, called manufacturing resource planning (MRP) systems. Over time, organizations added modules for managing other departments like accounting, support, sales, project management, inventory management, supply chain, and HR.\nERP solutions have become popular because they offer one system with a standard look and feel, a single integrated database, and standard processes across an organization.\nGartner lists the benefits of ERP systems as:\nThey are a catalyst for business innovation through making informed decisions.\nThey offer process efficiency derived from having all data in one place.\nThey offer process standardization across the organization.\nIT costs are saved when compared to maintaining and integrating a separate system for each area of a company.\nBy definition, an ERP system provides functionality to as much of a business as possible. The core is often the basis of an MRP system with financial modules and customer relationship management software (CRM) added. Some additional modules are:\nIntegration with point-of-sale systems and ecommerce\nHuman resource management (HRM)\nSales management\nWarehouse management\nMarketing automation\nMarketing content management\nInventory management\nPurchasing\nInvoicing\nCustomer portals\nVendor portals\nAlthough ERP systems started as a tool for large enterprises, they can deliver benefits to the SMB space as well. 67 percent of ERP solutions are hosted on-premise, with only 27 percent using a SaaS model\nWhat is open source?\nAs the name implies, the key difference between an open source software program and a proprietary one is that the source code is open. You can download it, read it, change it, compile it, and give it to other people. The official rules for what is open source are defined by the Open Source Initiative, and can be summarized as:\nFree Redistribution:\nAnyone can sell or give away any part of the software.\nSource Code:\nUsers must have easy access to the source code.\nDerived Work:\nAnyone can modify the software and redistribute the modified version.\nIntegrity of Author’s Source Code:\nAuthors can require that changes be done as patches or that modified versions are identified with different names or versions.\nNo Discrimination:\nAny person, group, or field of endeavor has access.\nNo Constraints on Use:\nThe licensing governing use must not be specific to a product, not restrict other software, and must be technology-neutral.\nAlthough many people focus on the “free ERP” aspect of open source, access to the source code can often deliver the most substantial long-term advantages. Also, open source solutions move control of the software from a vendor to your company. The most significant disadvantage is that you must have software development capabilities, either in-house or through a partner, to modify, compile, and support any type of open source solution.\nOpen source software solutions are also easier to work with because they use common programming languages like python, PHP, Java, and C++. They run on Linux and open databases like PostgreSQL, both of which are available for free or as supported enterprise edition solutions.\nWhy put open source and ERP together?\nAlthough open source ERP solutions are still a small part of the market, companies are finding significant benefits in the flexibility they allow. This comes in conjunction with increased usability and user adoption because they allow highly customized processes.\nSome of the reasons that companies are adopting open source ERP are:\nThey own and control what may be the most critical software system in the company, enabling customization and removing dependence on an outside provider.\nThe cost is lower; usually free before customization.\nWorldwide support exists from the development community, with the more common solutions sprouting companies to provide support.\nThe community is continually updating the tools behind the software whereas proprietary ERP often has older legacy tools that they can not upgrade.\nIn many ways, open source ERP is the middle ground between creating your own custom software from scratch and purchasing a proprietary tool. First off, it allows you to use the as-is solution for a while, for free or at meager cost, to understand what your needs are. This is an important step that is impossible when you write your own ERP and expensive with a solution from an outside vendor.\nCustomization takes work and skill but is manageable. The bulk of the software development has been done with open source when compared to creating a brand-new ERP system; the modules needed to gather, store, retrieve, and display data have been written and proven out. Instead of starting from scratch your development team or provider can start with that framework and, with access to the source code, make only the additions or changes you need.\nIn comparison to customizing a commercial solution, your team has access to the source code instead of a proprietary Application Programming Interface (API) or user interface customization tool that constrains what can be done. Nothing really beats seeing what a given module is actually doing and then changing the underlying code to get what you want. The same is true for changing workflows and user interfaces to create a more user-friendly experience.\nWhat should you do to start exploring open source ERP?\nThe first step in exploring an open source ERP solution is the same step you need to take for any considerable enterprise software effort—look at what you have now and understand what is working and what is not.\nOnce you have that in hand, learn from past ERP failures. Then turn your focus to what is essential for choosing an open source ERP tool.\nNail down and document your requirements, including mapping out business processes. Most of this step is the same as for any enterprise software effort, except that with open source you have to understand what you are starting with and what requirements you must add yourself.\nOnce you have your requirements (and management is on board, if applicable), start evaluating the wide variety of available open source ERP systems. While you are evaluating, make sure that they have the ability to work on mobile devices, they have robust security built in, and that you dig deep into the product reviews and user community comments to get a feel for any issues or missing capabilities.\nNext, it is time to focus on implementation and customization of your open source ERP system. If you have a strong development team in-house, get them involved early and use standard software development practices to plan and manage your project. The only difference from a standard project is that you are starting with the bulk of the software already written.\nIf you do not have an in-house team, it is time to pick a partner to build the ERP software you need from open source code. Choosing a company like Zibtek that provides strategy and design along with coding can make all the difference in the world. We have the experience and the processes in place to focus on our clients’ business needs and requirements and deliver functionality. We can also provide you with long-term user support as well as software fixes and enhancements that will grow the positive impact of your ERP system.

    "extractedText": "CRM\nSalesforce Sharepoint Integration\nIan J.H Reynolds\nExplore Ian J.H Reynolds' expertise in finance and economics through his insightful articles on market trends, investment strategies, and economic analysis.\nMore posts by Ian J.H Reynolds.\nIAN J.H REYNOLDS\n8 MAY 2020 • 6 MIN READ\nIf you've been researching software solutions for your business, there's no doubt that you may have come across Salesforce. The company provides cloud-based software services, specializing in customer relationship management services. It also offers a suite of other enterprise services revolving around analytics, automation and app development.\nWhile many companies may only rely on Salesforce, others look to integrate it with different apps, with SharePoint being a common integration. SharePoint is Microsoft's web-based collaborative platform that links up with Microsoft Office. It's primarily used as a document management and storage system. Companies like SharePoint because of its highly configurable nature, which is why it's also a preferred integration candidate for Sales force.\nWhat’s the point of integrating SharePoint and Salesforce?\nSalesforce is one of the more expensive CRM solutions out there but the vast majority of customers that use it appear to be happy with the service. However, businesses are highly sensitive to cost, and rarely pass up any opportunity to trim their expenses in order to further boost profitability.\nGood CRM solutions offer features that make it easier for employees to collaborate and in Salesforce, this task is handled by Salesforce Chatter. It's the default communication tool with user profiles, feeds and groups so that all of the users within the organization can work together.\nSalesforce Chatter can do all what its users need it to do, but at a cost. For example, users on the Chatter Free tier only get limited rights so while they can see profiles and share files, they can't see any Salesforce data or edit documents within the CRM.\nThis means that collaboration isn't as fluid between Salesforce users and employees without licenses as it should be. It can be, but it would require buying more Salesforce Sales Cloud licenses that start at $25 per month.\nEven though it's possible to bring in external users to Chatter, Salesforce only allows them access to a very limited number of features. They can't access events, calendar, content library and even contacts. So collaboration between internal and external users also suffers a disconnect.\nSharePoint doesn't suffer from these limitations and doesn't cost nearly as much as it would for an organization to pay for endless licenses. By integrating Salesforce with SharePoint, they can use the latter as their collaboration tool while keeping Salesforce as their CRM.\nIntegration between SharePoint and Salesforce streamlines the workflow and it benefits employees. An IDC research found that 36 percent of employees' days are spent looking for information while 44 percent of the time they can't find the information they're looking for.\nAdvantages to a Salesforce SharePoint Integration\nCost-savings are the primary reason why most organizations opt for SharePoint and Salesforce integration. The licensing cost per user for Salesforce is significantly higher in comparison. With this integration, organizations can have a full-fledged collaborative work environment for all of their departments without having to spend a fortune on licenses.\nThe integration also allows for improved document management. SharePoint supports automatic file versioning management for all documents that originate in Salesforce. This means that teams can have better control on documentation with a single search experience with the ability to easily review and edit documents. Online and mobile editing support is also present alongside native sharing.\nSharePoint makes document management possible on a large scale with maximum file size of attachments being 250MB, significantly higher than what Salesforce allows. Its data storage limits offer 1TB per organization in addition to 0.5GB per user license.\nDisadvantages\nThere may be some disadvantages to this integration, particularly if it's implemented using only the tools that Salesforce makes available. Salesforce makes Files Connect available for all editions. However, organizations that want to access on-premise files sources, must have a license to an Enterprise or above edition, which can end up being considerably more expensive.\nSalesforce Files Connect is normally used to integrate both services. The most current documentation for Files Connect shows that it only allows integration with SharePoint Online, even though earlier versions support SharePoint 2010 and 2013 on premises.\nSome organizations may also be wary of this integration because it would require them to store files in the cloud. They might not want to do that for certain confidential files or for user data. There may be data security compliance matters which may also prevent them from storing files off the premises.\nUsing two separate services to manage workflow will require additional training for employees. If they’re only just getting used to working with Salesforce, they might find it difficult to wrap their head around SharePoint, at least initially, which may lead to a dip in productivity.\nAnother disadvantage of this integration through Files Connect is that SharePoint effectively loses its focus as a collaboration hub for employees. This can cause unwanted friction between different teams.\nWhat’s the best way to integrate Salesforce with SharePoint?\nAnnounced in 2014, Salesforce Files Connect is widely considered to be one of the best ways to integrate these two services. The company developed this centralized, universal file-sharing solution to allow organizations to easily browse, search and share files in any repository from a single user interface.\nThe ease of use is certainly one of the biggest draws of Files Connect. Since everything is handled using the point-and-click tools, a Salesforce admin can easily set up the integration between these services. The process happens in real-time so everything can be and running fairly quickly.\nSalesforce continues to make enhancements to the Files Connect tool over time so its functionality increases and so does the number of services that it can offer integrations with. Files Connect also lets users search and work with SharePoint files within the CRM's user interface. It does that while keeping all content permissions intact.\nThere are other methods as well that can be used to set up the integration. Salesforce AppExchange provides access to special apps that can be used for the integration and this can also be done by a Safesforce admin. However, additional groundwork may be required to figure out settings and modifications before proceeding.\nFor more advanced and customized integrations, many organizations prefer tailored apps. They can opt to have a custom app developed that can provide Salesforce integration with SharePoint based on their exact requirements.\nFor example, sales reps would primarily work in Salesforce while business analysts would collaborate in SharePoint. A custom solution would allow a sales rep to start a discussion on a proposal without having to leave Salesforce while also being kept updated about further collaboration on it in SharePoint through automatic status notifications in Salesforce.\nWhen the final version of that proposal is added to SharePoint, the sales rep gets updated about it in Salesforce and they can then reach out to the customer. A custom solution in addition to the Files Connect integration would allow for sync between Salesforce and SharePoint workflows.\nAre there any other potential Salesforce integrations?\nCompanies that don't want to juggle two different services can simply make use of all the collaboration tools that Salesforce offers, such as Salesforce Files, CRM Content, Knowledge, Documents, Attachments and Extranet.\nHowever, it’s the high licensing costs that compel them to integrate with third-party services. Salesforce doesn’t prevent integration, rather, it facilitates them through Files Connect.\nOrganizations tend to use many different apps and Salesforce makes it easy to integrate with some of the most popular productivity and collaboration apps. The long list of supported integrations includes LinkedIn, DocuSign, and the cloud-storage service Dropbox.\nSalesforce also makes integration possible with the likes of Slack for virtual collaborative work spaces, Google's G Suite for additional cloud-based services, Mailchimp for email list management and Quickbooks for accurately tracking financial data.\nGet the right custom software for whatever integration you need.\nFiles Connect has several technical limitations, in that it only supports SharePoint document libraries, any other library type or list is not. There are also limitations with the indexing of files as PDF files, images and videos are not indexed in SharePoint by default.\nTherefore, more sophisticated profiles will almost always require custom software, and for that you need a developer that can understand what you’re looking for and has the necessary talent pool to create a custom solution based on your requirements.\nThe team at Zibtek is highly regarded for its software development prowess. Zibtek is one of the world's leading software development companies, working with fortune 500s and startups alike to create powerful custom software solutions that increase productivity and reduce cost.\nZibtek has offices in the United States in addition to a global talent pool of technology specialists that are all managed from the US.

    "extractedText": "BUSINESS\nThe Chicken and Egg Problem and How to Solve It\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n30 NOV 2018 • 3 MIN READ\nYou can find a lot of articles that talk about marketplaces. We will here attempt to understand a few of these theories about marketplaces and look at how various companies follow a particular strategy. One can measure the success of a company using various methods. But, we can understand it a lot better when we look at how efficiently businesses use capital and revenue.\nEvery business starting out needs to capture the attention of potential customers and scale the business to reach more customers. Looking at tried and true methods already used by successful businesses is the fastest way to learn what works.\nWhich came first: the chicken or the egg?\nAt its most basic level, a marketplace is nothing more than a mechanism for connecting people looking to sell with people looking to buy. Without that connection, suppliers would not be able to reach customers. Thus, the marketplace can charge a commission or fee on everything sold, because it is undeniably adding value and playing a vital role in the seller and customer experience. The perennial question, “What came first, the chicken or the egg?” applies here. Suppliers don’t want to be part of a market that is just starting out, so how does a new marketplace take off? Here a few strategies employed by successful marketplaces:\nStrategy 1: Single Player Mode\nWith strategic thinking, a business can overcome the “chicken and egg problem” by successfully getting both buyers and sellers interested in the new marketplace. There are several different ways to approach this. Sangeet Paul Choudary calls OpenTable’s seeding strategy the “Standalone Mode.” Chris Dixon calls this strategy “Single Player Mode.” In its early stages, OpenTable marketed software to restaurants and charged a subscription fee.\nThe unique CRM and table management system that they developed was something most of the restaurateurs wanted. By giving restaurant managers something they can benefit from on its own, OpenTable had half of the marketplace equation solved.\nOnce they were able to acquire more than a few hundred restaurants in the city, they began to offer diners a good reason to use the app. It is also quite interesting for us to note that almost all of the successful companies follow this strategy to become efficient. Marketplaces that choose to follow this seeding approach are 10x more capital efficient than those who do not follow this method.\nMore than a third of marketplaces use single player mode as the basis of their development strategy. In the case of OpenTable, they first acquired restaurants (the supply) before getting the diners (the demand).\nNow, a very famous example of a company that chose Single Player Mode is Amazon. Before it became the internet behemoth it is today, Amazon was a lowly bookseller. It used to purchase books from publishers and competing bookstores and turn around and sell them online direct to consumers. Thus, they had something to offer buyers as the foundation of what grew to a massive marketplace. Once Amazon had a huge customer or buyer base, they started allowing supply-side players to enter the marketplace.\n2nd Strategy: Find Customers for Suppliers\nNow, a third of marketplaces used a different method to seed supply. It is the way the suppliers can get rid of their surplus inventory, and it will also provide additional income for the existing business, which is never a bad thing.\nGroupon used this particular strategy to create a marketplace. They reached out to merchants first and asked them to see if they’d be interested in offering gift cards or other promotions at a discounted rate. It is one of the great ways to attract a lot of new customers and also fill in slow periods. The service didn’t cost businesses anything; Groupon just takes a small percentage of the sale.\nGroupon used to offer one discounted promotion per day, and they used platforms such as Google and Facebook to market these products aggressively. They were successful in acquiring supply before creating any traction in demand. Uber is another company that followed this path to build a thriving marketplace.\n3rd Strategy: Build a Marketplace Where Buyers can sell and Sellers can Buy\nThe last of the most popular strategies for building marketplaces is to focus on building an environment in which buyers can also sell. It is an excellent way to acquire both demand and supply. The successful businesses that have followed this approach to cultivating demand and supply at once are shopping apps such as Craigslist and eBay.\nThis strategy will not work unless you have a lot of overlap between people interesting in buying and those looking to sell. Once up and running, these types of marketplaces generate continual transactions. Of course, you need something to bring people in the door, so to speak. To attract the initial set of users, some companies following this strategy have employed TV ads.\nIn conclusion:\nIt is interesting to note that the marketplaces that are seeded using a single player mode will have almost 10x the advantage when it comes to capital efficiency. This strategy seems to be a better option than finding buyers for the suppliers. The reasons why the single-player mode strategy is the best is because there is far less competition and lower churn. If you have plans to use any other strategies, it’s a good idea for you to consider various setbacks before taking things forward. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

    "extractedText": "BUSINESS\nHow to Build a Two-Sided Marketplace\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n9 NOV 2018 • 3 MIN READ\nBuilding a two-sided marketplace is something that is no easy feat. Though it may seem obvious on paper, it is quite tricky to handle. Almost all startup founders tell us the same thing. They think that building a two-sided marketplace is something that is quite difficult, though it is also extremely attractive from a business perspective. While it is true that is is difficult in many respects, there are plenty of examples that prove that you can still achieve it.\neBay is one of the examples of being able to create a two-sided marketplace. oDesk is another excellent example. Nowadays, Airbnb is doing the same thing as the other two applications but in the vacation rental market.\nUnderstanding Liquidity Hacking\nLiquidity hacking is one of those strategies that the successful marketplace businesses employ in an endeavor to reduce the challenges that you can associate with low transaction volumes. It is necessary to narrow down the scope drastically if you care to achieve it. You may need to do this drastically till you can find sufficient scale to either expand or accomplish a broader marketplace.\nThis type of hacking is something that you need to do in order to succeed in this market sector. It is imperative for you to realize that the marketplace businesses works well only when it is at scale. If you have hundreds or thousands of users, either on the supply side or the demand side, then everything might work well for you. But the significant problem that you might face is how to get to that point.\nNeed to Provide Value\nOffer Portfolios\nMost people these days would like to showcase their work online. In years past, people used to do this by creating a custom or a personalized website. Fortunately, these days things have become quite simple.\nYou can find an array of online tools that any individual can use on various applications. By allowing users to utilize the portfolio tool on the web application, you can solve the supply challenge that you have. Behance, Dribble, and Carbonmade are three of the web applications that are successful in showcasing work.\nBuild Community\nYour focus next is to build both a healthy and vibrant community on either both sides of the equation. When you do this, you will end up with the potential for an excellent marketplace. StackOverflow is one of the best examples that you can find of a robust and active community.\nTools You Offer\nEnsure that there are many free tools that your users can utilize for without any fees. By doing this, you will increase the number of users on one side of the equation. Git, OpenTable has some of the web application tools that provide this option to their users.\nScrape Listings\nFor example, you may plan on scrapping real estate listing using the website Craigslist. You should then plan on modifying the list with a better UX. It is quite challenging to connect the supply and demand mainly since you do not own the supply yet. You are going to get the best conversion rate when you let the supplier know that you have a customer in place that they can access once they register or sign up for free.\nNarrow Down the Problem\nIt is quite essential for you to focus where your efforts are going towards the business. Since you are going to work with limited resources, it is necessary for you to use them wisely and optimally. Some of the things that you may plan on doing are the following:\nYour Primary focus should be on the geography. It is obvious. Check every local marketplace that is available.\nIt is essential for you to focus on a niche community rather than putting efforts on everything. Lastly, it is necessary for you to focus on one particular vertical.\nCurate One Side\nOne of the best ways to make things functional when it is at low volume is to curate one side. Many people are not sure if a “curated marketplace” is a real marketplace. Curation is one of the essential things that you might need to do. It opens the doors for you to move from a listings model to an open-call transactional model.\nOne of the best ways to bring efficiency to your model is by choosing this particular method. YourMechanic is one of the best examples when it comes to this kind of model. Instead of throwing a massive list or directory, they give you the option to select one among the two mechanics shown. It is effortless to choose one of them as they both seem to be good.\nUse Hamsters\nWhen nothing is working, it might be essential for you to use hamsters. It is one of the brute force methods. Initially, oDesk was acting more or less like a recruiting agency. But the team never lost the vision of what it could become in the future. They used to search for a candidate to meet the demands manually. Over a period, things progressed. Now, there is enough supply and demand. You need to start throwing bodies at the problem until you have enough scale that can assist you in reducing the manual requirements in a process. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

    "extractedText": "BUSINESS\nHow The CTO And VP Of Engineering Differ\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n11 OCT 2018 • 4 MIN READ\nMany startups want to know how to build their engineering team. Many non-technical startup founders find it hard to accurately define the terms “CTO” and “VP of Engineering.” Understanding the basics is helpful if you want to gain an understanding of these roles and how they can work in your growing business.\nHere is some background on these critical job roles and their basics responsibilities.\nThe Chief Technology Officer\nIn order to get your tech business off the ground, you need a seasoned engineer to act as lead architect. Such a person is often referred to in the industry as a “rockstar,” and if you’ve ever worked with someone like this, you know the description is accurate. Unless you have a person who is strategizing the development of your technology, it’s going to be hard, if not impossible, to reach your company’s full potential. Having a tech guru on your team is quite beneficial. He or she will play a crucial role in putting your ideas on track to succeed.\nThe most important thing you will look for in them is that they are on the cutting edge of technology trends and understand the industry as a whole. They have a clear understanding of various frameworks such as Spring, Hibernate, Lucene, Cassandra, and Hadoop. Choosing between MySQL and Postgres should be an easy decision. Programming languages should be second nature, and they should have an instinct for which is the right one to grow with your product. If you have someone who can maneuver these tough decisions in the early days of your startup, you will be in great shape going forward. You cannot build a skyscraper without the help of an experienced engineer as they are the ones who provide you with the infrastructure on which everything else depends.\nThings That Set Them Apart\nAn interesting way of thinking about it is that technologists are almost like artists. Like many artists, they are unpredictable, can suffer from stormy moods, work erratically (but, of course, they’ll get done what they need to do, even if it means working right up to the deadline), and they refuse to submit the necessary documentation. In other words, these types of creatives make horrible managers and should not be given a leadership role–and most often they wouldn’t want a leadership role!\nYou might also have some confusion about the difference between a CTO and a “chief architect.” The only difference of any significance is how much experience they have. CTOs have a proven track record and a wide range of experience, while chief architects are often just starting out..\nIn general, you want your CTOs and chief architects to be exacting. You need them to be sticklers and unrelenting in their pursuit of a vision in order for your product to develop as best as possible. The attitude toward quality that your CTO or chief architect has will set the tone for the whole team, so you want them to be committed to high standards.\nVP of Engineering\nA VP of engineering is a person who has extensive technical knowledge and experience but prefers the business side to busting out code. He or she is the person who has an aptitude for management, especially of dev teams. VPs of engineering often have expertise in different specialities, be it C++ or Excel, and they also have a general knowledge of technologies from a global view. You’ll want to make sure that your VP of engineering will ensure proper testing, automating many of your quality controls.\nYou can think of the VPs of engineering as the ones who keep the machine running smoothly. Keeping all the moving parts on schedule and getting the most out of the team is their specialty. VPs of engineering also serve as a liaison between the head of the company and the person in charge of product management. Usually, it is the VP of engineering that you take to meetings with your biggest prospective clients to solidify a deal.\nThey are the people’s manager. Apart from knowing the technical stuff well, they also understand how to motivate people. They are the type of people who can keep track of preferences, personal issues and individual needs. VPs of engineering know when to hit the gas and ride the team to meet a key deadline and when to put the brakes on and adjust timelines based on the team’s needs. You don’t want your best devs to face burnout on long, complex projects.\nProject Manager\nA small startup might not require a project manager, but once the company scales up, it’s usually a good idea for you to get one. A project manager will be able to handle various issues that you face once you launch your product, especially if the customers who are paying money for your services are increasing drastically. These are some of the things he or she will be doing:\nChanges the technical documentation when you release new features for your product.\nTakes care of revisions to marketing materials, including the website.\nTrains the customer service representatives on the elements of the new features.\nAssists in rolling new features into overall marketing strategy and market positioning.\nIn Conclusion\nIf you’ve recently founded a small startup, you will need to have some key people on the team. One person you need to consider is a chief architect. While outsourcing is a good option, sometimes it might not work well for you. Instead of trying to cut corners, it is wise to work closely with a chief architect in-house. Once your team expands to 10-20 people, you should plan on hiring a CTO or VP of Engineering and have him or her report to you directly. Once you acquire a lot of customers and your business has reached the milestone of a significant profit margin, it’s time for you to add a project manager. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

    "extractedText": "BUSINESS\n4 Effective Ways To Build A Product Roadmap\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n3 OCT 2018 • 4 MIN READ\nIn a nutshell, a product roadmap is an essential visual summary that lays out the vision and direction of a project or product(s) ideation. A product roadmap lets you know what your product can offer over a period of time and let you pivot to provide what your customers need as you develop it. That being said, you need to understand that creating a product roadmap is a multi-step process. Necessarily it is a process because you first need to set your strategic plans as well as product vision.\nIt does not matter if you have some experience in the past creating the roadmap or do not have any experience. It is, however, essential that you make one. A chief goal is to keep you focused! Built correctly, a roadmap should apply pressure on you to complete projects on task if you are otherwise not careful. You need to realize that the stakeholders of your company including the customers have the right to review the roadmap and will very likely influence priorities.\nYou should never look at the product roadmap like an operation to-do list. It is necessary for you to know that it is a strategic document that you design to assist you in developing a plan for your product. It can also assist you in putting your team on the path in carrying out that plan.\nAs a product manager, you might be thinking that you can jot down the themes, plan, and the best features of the product. Yes – you need these things in preparing the roadmap. It is critical for you to realize the fact that an overly simplistic plan can lead to several other problems. You need to work on specific guidelines if you want to prepare a good roadmap.\nFirst Determine the ‘Why’ for the Product\nYou first need to ask several questions such as why you are developing this product during this particular time. What kind of specific attributes it needs to have and who are the customers that are going to benefit using this product.\nThese are the fundamental strategic questions that you might need to ask yourself and your crew. You need to review the ‘why’ information each time you are planning to create a new product or planning to update the existing product. If you cannot answer these critical questions, it is useless to spend any money or resources developing the product. Generate enough data to back up your decision making\nIt is startling to note that most of the product managers with significant experience and talent in some cases skip this crucial step. It might be because they think it is okay to follow their gut feelings rather than putting across the answers on a sheet of paper.\nNo doubt, their assumption is that it takes much more time to create the roadmap than just starting. product managers who think it is okay to rush forward in creating the roadmap often end up missing crucial elements of their project.\nPlan Carefully\nYou need to realize the fact that this first step is going to be beneficial to you if you plan carefully. It can make a significant impact to your product during the development phase and eliminate unnecessary efforts. And, it will serve you well beyond the product’s launch. Your product can be successful if you with your team put efforts to determine your products core purpose for existing in the first place.\nNot to mention that having a defined core purpose might also assist you in marketing the product over and above cohesive decisions. At the end of the day, you need to sell the product and having a product roadmap your stakeholders can believe in can be an important part of that process. With the right tools, you can also get their support as well.\nSecond Determine Your Target Audience and Tailor the Product Roadmap\nNow, this is another thing that product managers forget when preparing the product roadmap. The product roadmap you present to the stakeholders, engineers, marketing team and customers cannot be the same. As you know, particular priorities are different for each one of them. You need to make the necessary modifications to your roadmap to ensure it is apt for each of these groups.\nIt is necessary for you to understand the fact that your stakeholders do not need to see information that is irrelevant to them. Some information might be relevant to the marketing or development team. The stakeholders want to know more about how the product roadmap can assist in increasing the market share.\nA development team might not need the information that is not relevant to them. Instead, the development team might require information such as the technology you want the developers to use and the time-frame that you have set for the product development. You want your sales team to draw from the roadmap the insights on how they can convince the potential customers to purchase the product.\nTry developing a product roadmap using a dynamic tool that your team use for documents such as a spreadsheet. Allowing yourself to create various versions of the roadmap. You can change the priorities of the roadmap for each version to ensure it is relevant to your audience.\nThird Build Your Actual Product Roadmap\nOnce you have completed the first two steps and have found the right roadmap tool, you need to actually build the product roadmap. Reflect on the essential elements of the roadmap we described above.\n(1) First, determine the dominant theme of the product.\n(2) Create a swimlane it is necessary for you to create a swimlane on the product roadmap with its themes\n(3) Since you now have a series of themes, you need to begin to layer them in epics.\nAdd details:\nyou might have to layer the specific features as well underneath each epic.\nQuestion yourself several times to understand the value a theme brings to a roadmap. You also need to know how it works in conjunction with other themes that are on the roadmap.\nAn important note: Your Product Roadmap Should Be Flexible\nhe next most important thing that you need to keep in mind. You need to be ready to make significant changes to the roadmap in the future. These changes might happen because of several factors. It might be because of resource level change, or competitors strategic moves, the date of your product release or development. You need to recognize the fact that you might have to make several changes to the roadmap once you build it. Stick to the premise, not the paper. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

From location to style and finishing options there are tons of elements to account for all while keeping comfort, aesthetic, and price in mind. While much of the process is exciting, some of it can be downright daunting. Choosing a builder alone takes hours of research and making sure you’ve found the right one takes even longer. Based on the builder you choose, your new home can look any number of ways if not given blueprints to guide the construction team. Building a house is complex. It takes many people with varied skill sets to complete the finished product. Sounds like software development, doesn’t it?\nBuilding software is in fact, a lot like building a home. Something as big an investment as custom software is not to be taken lightly. You wouldn’t let your carpenter pick out your carpet and wall colors would you? No! Then you shouldn’t expect a software engineer to create something that is unclear or not well defined.\nBecause greatness is never achieved in solitude, here are a few examples of essential roles for new construction and their software development counterparts:\nThe Architect // The UX or UI Designer\nIn home construction, the architect is generally the first person who gathers information from you on what you’d ideally want. They are the initial planner for both structural and aesthetic design. They form your blueprints. In software, the UX/UI designer is responsible for making your product fit your user’s needs. The blueprints in home construction serve the same purpose as wireframes in software development. They guide the team on what and how to build your product, as well as guide them on sprint planning, materials needed, and total cost.\nThe Contractor // The Development Team\nThe contractor and his team take your home from just blueprints to an actual building. They are responsible for the structure and the elements that make your home unique. These teams are comparable as the developers will take the wireframes and create a working product from a simple mockup. The construction team includes framing workers, finishers, electricians, and plumbers. On the software side, this team includes back-end developers, front-end developers, and QA analysts.\nThe Interior Designer // The Marketing Team\nThough interior designers are not always within a home buyer’s budget, it’s often obvious when they’ve been involved as the new home looks like it’s ready for a Home & Garden photo shoot. These people are responsible for choosing finishing options that fit your style and make your home look great. They take the information they’ve been given about your preferences in color scheme, materials, and what’s available to them structurally to create a comfortable and beautiful space. The equivalent in software development is the marketing team. They will look at your finished product and make it fit with your brand via the ideal content and design. It’s not enough to have a functioning product; you’re offering must be visually appealing and effectively communicated to your target market for the best adoption.\nTips for Building New Software\nWhen you’re building a home in your 30’s, you’re probably thinking about egress window coverings and whether or not you can get away with solely wall mounted cabinetry. It makes sense, you’ve got to build a home that suits your family’s lifestyle. Will that same home suit you when you’re entering retirement? You probably don’t need the same toddler-proof fortress you once did, though you may want to forego the stairs…\nBuilding software with the future in mind is the key to growing Agile and not wasting budget on a website or product redesign. New software takes planning, and in the world of custom development that planning means wireframes! We are quite possibly the development world’s biggest proponent of the Lean Methodology, and it is an entirely worthwhile step in the development process. Having wireframes makes the developer’s job so much less ambiguous. It also allows the developer to focus on making his code work rather than choosing colors that represent your brand. You’ll get what you want, and you’ll even get a more accurate quote for how much it will cost.\nFeatures in your home and your software are one in the same. Some features may need to be prioritized over others. If you love to cook, then spring for the fancy hood vents. Similarly with software, if you’ve got a user-based product, adding a chat function may be completely necessary. You’d never say to a builder, “I want a three bedroom, one bathroom home” and let him choose everything else! You’d give the builder blueprints and hire a team of individuals to create the home of your dreams. When your software development partner has wireframes, mockups or any visual guide they can choose the best ways to create features, integrations, and even pricing.\nIf you make poor choices when designing the home of your dreams, you’ve got to live with it. Building new software is just the same. When designing a new home, you have to look at it from all angles. You wouldn’t want a house that’s meticulously thought-out on the inside but looks like a big box on the outside. Software development is exactly the same. Don’t let all this talk of extensive software planning scare you! We’ve got a team of tech gurus waiting with bated breath to guide you on killer software construction.

There are many different avenues you could take to find funding. A great fit for startups are venture capitalists (VCs). The number of investors that you need to approach and the things that you may plan on talking with them are some things that might be running in your mind as you consider the prospect of VCs.\nPeople have different perspectives on the best methods that you can use. Many people prefer the shotgun approach. In this particular method, the main idea is to pitch to as many investors as possible. Now, most of the startups feel that this is the right way to become successful and gives the best odds of getting the funding that is necessary.\nWhile there are many different notions that are prevailing in the startup world, here are some simple guidelines that will assist you in making that perfect pitch.\nFind A VC Who Matches Well With Your Company\nYou need to remember always that one good investor that matches well with your firm is better than a 100 investors that do not. It is true that the venture capitalists main job is to filter out companies that they do not see value in investing in. They only back companies that they think will succeed. Of course, it is one of the most crucial parts of their process.\nBut your company also needs to filter out the VCs that do not seem to be the right match for your company. It is necessary for you to realize that you need a VC’s help beyond them signing a check. A good VC who understands your business well will give you appropriate guidance and assistance. Their insights will be quite valuable and can help you become successful. Money is not the only criteria that matter when you are searching for a VC.\nUnfortunately, for most startups, raising money is the only thing that runs through their mind. They do not see a larger picture because they are blinded and want to seize any opportunity that can help them in getting the necessary funds.\nSearch for the Right Investor\nWhen you find the right investor, you are going to have countless benefits apart from getting the required funds. Not many are aware of the advantages that they get to enjoy by choosing the right one. Here are some of the most excellent benefits:\nExpand Your Network\nYes, when you are using the right VC, one of the first things that you will be able to do is to expand your network. A good investor does more than give you a check. They want to help the business grow and prosper as they believe it is the only way for them to succeed as well.\nAs a result, they will not hesitate to introduce you to their high-level connections. In case you are going with a VC that has no contacts in your industry, the chances for you to expand your business are fewer. They might not be of any value to you.\nFits Your Culture\nNow, this is the immediate next thing that you need to check when you are selecting a VC. They need to resonate with and embody the values as well as the ideas that actually drive your team. If you do not check this aspect when considering a VC, you might end up in friction down the road which might not be a good thing for your company.\nCountless companies have compromised on this aspect and as a result, failed. You want the VC who is going to fund your company also to have an interest in your firm.\nConsider the Vertical Experience\nFinding a VC who has good knowledge and experience in your vertical is going to benefit your company. Now, they might be one who can align well with your company’s strategy. They can provide you with advice and insights that are valuable.\nMost importantly, they are the ones who find value in the products and services that you offer. They can track the various opportunities that are available in the market and introduce the same to you. Now, this is worth more than gold.\nKnow Their Bandwidth\nSome of the VCs are very successful, and this is reflected in the fact that they have a large portfolio. While it is something that the VC might be proud of, it may not be something that should attract you. Since they have so many things on their plate, they might not be that interested in providing the influence and insights to your company.\nWhile you might not need constant care and nurturing, you do require a VC that can engage in your operations to a certain degree. If a VC has absolutely no time for your company, though they might be great, they might not be the right fit.\nIt is necessary for you to chase quality instead of quantity when you are searching for a VC to fund your company. The benefits are going to be 10x when you find the right one. By using the shotgun approach, you are going to waste your and their valuable time. Always be targeted to succeed in finding the right VC. LinkedIn Twitter Email"

This trip has been a long-standing tradition for our CEO, Cache Merrill and has become a favorite for several other members of our US team. While the teams talk online everyday, it’s nice to get everyone together in person to talk about client projects, plans for Zibtek’s future, and to enjoy some lassi on the beach.\nEach year, our team visits a local Pune orphanage to visit the little girls they’ve come to know and love. This orphanage sponsors the children’s schooling as well as their care. In the past we’ve brought books and computers to them that they can use for their schooling. This year, our India-based developers will be going to the orphanage to teach a computer class on Saturdays.\nCache recounted this February’s trip saying, “Every time we come we have visited this one orphanage, so for about 5 years now. It’s really cool because we have seen these girls basically grow up. Now, our India team visits them even when we’re not around.They like to play games with the kids and they usually bring cake, which never disappoints.”\nWhile not working at the India office, the Zibtek gang enjoys the milder weather of Pune (it’s not that warm in Salt Lake City in February). This year Cache, Jared, our US-based Project Manager and Tushar, our VP of Development, enjoyed a spirited cricket match, cheering on India as they played the Australians. They decided to paint their faces with the Indian colors as many fans thought they were there to support the Australian team. Jared in particular doesn’t exactly look like an India native…\nThe trip is usually rounded out with a weekend spent in Goa on the beach.\nWhat makes our annual trip to the India office so great is that we have time to sit with each of our client’s development teams to create real problem solving solutions. Something about whiteboarding with everyone in the same room leads to innovation. This year’s trip was just as great as year’s past with plenty of time spent bonding with the India team, enjoying time at the beach and visiting our friends at the orphanage.

Discover how it validates ideas, identifies problems early, and enhances stakeholder communication. Explore modern techniques like digital prototyping and MVPs, and get best practices for effective prototyping.\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n18 APR 2018 • 2 MIN READ\nIn today's fast-paced digital landscape, prototyping remains a crucial step in the product development process. It allows businesses to visualize their ideas, test assumptions, and refine their concepts before committing significant resources to development. Here’s an updated look at why prototyping is essential and how it benefits modern product development.\nWhy Prototyping Matters\n1. Validate Your Idea\nBefore investing time and money into full-scale development, prototyping helps validate your idea with real users and stakeholders. By creating a tangible representation of your concept, you can gather valuable feedback and make necessary adjustments.\nAccording to a survey by the Product Development and Management Association (PDMA), companies that use prototypes in their development process experience a 20% higher success rate in product launches.\n2. Identify and Solve Problems Early\nPrototyping allows you to identify potential issues and solve them early in the development process. This proactive approach can save significant time and resources by preventing costly changes later on.\nExample: A tech startup used a prototype to test their new app's user interface. Feedback revealed navigation issues, which they corrected before the full development, saving them from extensive post-launch fixes.\n3. Enhance Stakeholder Communication\nPrototypes serve as an effective communication tool among team members, stakeholders, and investors. They provide a clear, visual representation of the product, making it easier to convey ideas and get everyone on the same page.\n\"Prototyping bridges the gap between concept and reality, enabling clearer communication and more informed decision-making.\" – John Perry, Product Manager at J-26\nModern Prototyping Techniques\n1. Digital Prototyping\nTools like Figma, Sketch, and Adobe XD allow for the creation of interactive digital prototypes that mimic the final product's functionality. These tools are particularly useful for web and app development, enabling designers to efficiently create and test user interfaces.\nExample: A retail company used Figma to create a clickable prototype of their new e-commerce platform. This allowed them to conduct user testing and refine the user journey before starting development.\n2. Minimum Viable Product (MVP)\nAn MVP is a version of the product with just enough features to attract early adopters and validate the product idea. It’s a cost-effective way to test the market and gather feedback for future development.\nAccording to Lean Startup methodology, businesses that develop MVPs can reduce time to market by up to 50% and improve user feedback efficiency.\nPrototyping Best Practices\nStart Simple: Begin with low-fidelity prototypes to quickly test concepts and gather initial feedback. Gradually move to high-fidelity prototypes as your ideas become more refined.\nIterate Frequently: Prototyping is an iterative process. Use feedback from each prototype to make improvements and create subsequent versions.\nEngage Users Early: Involve potential users in the prototyping process to ensure that the product meets their needs and expectations.\nConclusion\nPrototyping is an indispensable part of modern product development, offering numerous benefits from idea validation to problem-solving and stakeholder communication. By adopting effective prototyping techniques and best practices, businesses can significantly enhance their product development process and increase their chances of success.\nAt Zibtek, our team of expert developers and designers can help you navigate the complexities of product development, ensuring that your ideas are transformed into successful products.

    "extractedText": "CUSTOM SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT\nTop 10 Countries To Outsource Software Development\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n18 APR 2018 • 7 MIN READ\nTo compete in today’s economy, every business must become a digital business. And while consumers appreciate the convenience, the cost involved with digitizing everything is a significant burden to bear on the business owner. So how do companies afford top-notch software development? They outsource it.\nOutsourcing is anything but new. The US has been outsourcing since the ’80s, and there are no indications of the trend slowing down. The reason for its massive adoption is that companies can hire someone else to execute on some task or project while they focus on whatever it is they’re good at. So if everyone’s doing it, you’ve got to be asking yourself, “where’s all this work going?” We’ll show you the top countries for outsourcing and what makes them so popular.\nThere has been a recent surge of US companies utilizing domestic sourcing. This is a good option for those who only want to work with other US-based persons. While this may be good for some company cultures, it leaves little to be desired concerning cost. Not to mention, opportunities to diversify the labor pool and source the absolute best talent globally rather than locally.\nAs a company, Zibtek has decades of experience working with outsourcers from all over the globe. We’ve compiled crucial information about outsourcing with some of the globe’s best tech hubs. With a world full of tech-literate professionals, it’s hard to know where the best place to outsource software development is. The top contenders for tech are India, Bulgaria, China, Argentina, Egypt, China, India, the Philippines, Chile, Brazil, Indonesia, and Thailand. We’ve compared manpower, education, English skills, cultural factors, and value. Value is calculated on a 1-10 (10 being the best value) scale taking all other factors into account.\n#1 INDIA\nManpower: 1.324 billion\nEducation: 74% literacy rate. Much has changed for India since its British rule until 1947. While this literacy rate is slightly lower than some other countries on this list, math is heavily emphasized in schools throughout India leading to many technology based degree programs throughout the nation.\nEnglish skills: 125 million people in India speak English. This means that India is the second-largest English speaking country.\nCultural factors: Because of India’s early British rule, much of the country has a very western approach to education. Both speaking English and having a white-collar job in India are very prestigious. Indian call centers have been around (and often hung up on) for years. As the nation has grown, literacy rates have risen, and India has become the number one country for outsourcing. Modern day India is a tech hub with the bandwidth needed to communicate with US-based firms. The path for Indian outsourcing was paved years ago by US-based innovators who knew they could get high-quality development for less than what is charged in the US. Indian programmers have been offering solutions likesystem migration, legacy system maintenance, system integration, application development, and more.\nValue: 9.7\n#2 BULGARIA\nManpower: 7.128 million\nEducation: 98.6% literacy rate. 83.8% of males and 81.5% of females attend secondary school.\nEnglish skills: 25% of Bulgarians speak English.\nCultural factors: Bulgaria is becoming quite the contender for Eastern European outsourcing. Due to Eastern Europe’s focus on education, Bulgaria has become an outsourcing mecca like its counterpart, Ukraine. Since the country’s government reform to qualify for induction into the EU, its business culture has benefited. Many Bulgarian developers are highly proficient with challenging programming languages like C++.\nValue: 8.2\n#3 CHINA\nManpower: 1.379 billion\nEducation: 95% literacy rate. This is an enormous improvement from late 90’s polling reporting a 78% literacy rate. Even with only 5% illiteracy, China’s population of non-readers is 54 million people.\nEnglish skills: 10 million English speakers. While that sounds like a lot, keep China’s large population in mind. This is roughly 1 in 100 Chinese English speakers.\nCultural factors: China has been a popular outsourcing destination for more than just software for decades. In programming and manufacturing alike, China has provided US outsourcers with a lower cost option for services rendered. Because of China’s size and heavy emphasis on math and science in primary and secondary schooling, many young professionals have coding chops. While China’s literacy rate is on the rise, its percentage of English speakers is low. This has created a communication barrier for US outsourcers in the past. Another less obvious concern is China’s discretion on intellectual property. Working with a Chinese outsourcer may lead to code ownership and updating issues if not previously discussed.\nValue: 7.8\n#4 ARGENTINA\nManpower: 43.42 million\nEducation: 98.1% literacy rate. While Argentina boasts an excellent literacy rate, the number of Argentine people pursuing secondary education is slim, the country ranks 120 out of 197.\nEnglish skills: Spanish is the #1 spoken language, but English is a close second with nearly 50% of the population being bilingual.\nCultural factors: Argentina is an attractive option for those seeking a similar culture. The cultural norms of Argentines are closer to the majority of the US. The Argentine economy has not been as strong in the last decade as previous years. Some see this as a sign of little support for technology-based education. Optimists, on the other hand, see this as a great opportunity to hire programmers for a lower rate.\nValue: 7.8\n#5 THE PHILIPPINES\nManpower: 103.3 million\nEducation: 95.6% literacy rate. Prior to World War 1, the country’s literacy rate was just 20%. Much progress has been made since the 1960’s and education in the country continues to be a top priority.\nEnglish skills: 76% of Filipinos report being able to understand English, with similar results for reading in English and even thinking in English. Only 8% of the pool from this study reported not understanding English at all.\nCultural factors: The currency in The Philippines has recently appreciated, driving wages up slightly but also indicating a good sign of stability and growth as a nation. Many Filipinos have close cultural affinities with western regions, making partnership and collaboration easier for first time outsourcers. The Philippines have been known as an outsourcing destination for back office or less skilled work. Because of this type of work, quality standards for software development must be vetted early on.\nValue: 7.1\n#6 EGYPT\nManpower: 95.69 million\nEducation: 73.8% literacy rate with a disparity amongst genders, 82.2% male and 65.4% female.\nEnglish skills:35% of Egyptians speak English.\nCultural factors: Egypt is becoming increasingly popular amongst the middle east as an option for software outsourcing. In fact, many of India’s software giants are opening satellite offices in Egypt because of it’s strong IT centered workforce. The country is recognized for its young working population that continues to grow. The downside however is that much of the middle east remains politically volatile, making it less appealing for some western businesses.\nValue: 6.6\n#7 CHILE\nManpower: 17.91 million\nEducation: 96% literacy rate. This is the highest literacy rate of all countries in Latin America. Chile uses an education voucher system made popular by Europe. 93% of Chilean children go to public school, with the remaining 7% attending private school.\nEnglish skills: About 5% of the total population of Chile speaks fluent English. This is a relatively small portion of the population, especially for a tech affluent country with many IT-centered businesses headquartered here.\nCultural factors: Chile is no newbie to offshoring. In fact, more than 20% of the country’s total exports to the US alone. Chile also has the most stable government in the area and an open immigration policy to boot, making it easy for global talent to funnel into the country. If you’ve ever been to Chile, you know it’s beautiful and pricey… the downside to outsourcing your development here is that the cost for anything is much higher than some of the other alternatives. It should be noted too that the average cost for a programmer in the US is still much higher than Chile.\nValue: 6.1\n#8 BRAZIL\nManpower: 207.7 million\nEducation: 92.6% literacy rate, growing at an annual rate of 0.49%\nEnglish skills: 3% of the total population of Brazil is fluent in English, about 6.18 million.\nCultural factors: The country is working very hard at rebuilding its economy, 2015 and 2016 were the country’s worst recession in history. This situation is a bit of a catch 22 for companies looking to outsource as some may be thinking that the exchange rate makes development here very affordable, others may be thinking that because of the economic downturn, it’s not a place where innovation and cutting-edge technology is built. Brazil makes a great outsourcing destination for companies looking to have more basic, legacy software built.\nValue: 5.7\n#9 INDONESIA\nManpower: 261.1 million\nEducation: 95.38% literacy rate.\nEnglish skills: While statistics on the percentage of English speakers in Indonesia are mixed, English is growing in popularity. As the middle and upper economic classes of Indonesia have grown, more schools put emphasis on learning English.\nCultural factors: The main point to be noted about outsourcing to Indonesia is it’s drastic difference from US communication. While publicly reprimanding your product owner at the office is ok in New York, it’s not in Indonesia. Indonesia people are quite indirect in their speaking and a very caring as a population. Note these differences in early talks with Indonesian outsourced talent and tailor your questions to be literal and specific, especially about timeline. While these cultural differences may scare some US companies away, many successful enterprises have been outsourcing to Indonesia for years with minimal hiccups.\nValue: 5.1\n#10 THAILAND\nManpower: 68.86 million\nEducation: 96.4% literacy rate and has been growing linearly since the 1980s.\nEnglish skills: About 27% of the total population of Thailand speaks some English. Because of its appeal to tourists, many Thai people learn to speak some English for job advancement.\nCultural factors: Thailand is one of the most finally attractive outsourcing destinations in the world. Its business environment however is lack-luster for some outsourcers attempting to develop software using up and coming technology stacks. The culture overall lacks western-like problem solving skills based on mathematical reasoning, a major factor in programming work. Outsourcing to Thailand is typically successful when development is done on the front-end.\nValue: 4.8\nAt Zibtek, we offer custom software solutions for businesses of all sizes.

Serverless Architecture\nServerless architecture allows developers to build and run applications without managing server infrastructure. This approach can reduce costs, improve scalability, and streamline development.\nThe serverless market is projected to grow to $7.72 billion by 2029, according to MarketsandMarkets.\nAWS Lambda and Azure Functions are popular serverless computing services that enable developers to run code in response to events without provisioning servers.\n6. Jamstack Architecture\nJamstack is an architecture designed to make the web faster, more secure, and easier to scale. By decoupling the frontend from the backend, Jamstack allows for static site generation, reducing the need for server-side processing.\nAccording to a survey by Netlify, 32% of developers are now using Jamstack for their web projects.\n\"Jamstack is redefining web architecture by emphasizing performance and security, making it an excellent choice for modern web development.\" – Alex Johnson, Frontend Developer at Creative Web Solutions.\n7. Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR)\nAR and VR technologies are increasingly being integrated into web development, offering immersive user experiences for e-commerce, real estate, education, and more. These technologies can enhance user engagement and provide innovative ways to interact with content.\nOne everyday example is IKEA's AR app, which allows users to visualize how furniture would look in their homes, improving the shopping experience and reducing returns.\n8. Enhanced Web Security\nWith the rise in cyber threats, web security has become a top priority. New security technologies and practices, such as HTTPS, Content Security Policy (CSP), and multi-factor authentication (MFA), are being widely adopted to protect user data and ensure secure interactions.\nCybersecurity Ventures predicts that global cybercrime costs will reach $10.5 trillion annually by 2025.\n\"Prioritizing web security is essential for protecting user data and maintaining trust in digital services.\" – Emily Davis, Cybersecurity Expert at Secure Web Technologies.\n9. Voice Search Optimization\nAs voice-activated devices become more prevalent, optimizing websites for voice search is becoming increasingly important. This involves using natural language processing (NLP) to understand user queries and providing concise, relevant answers.\nBy 2024, it is estimated that 50% of all searches will be voice searches, according to Comscore.\nExample: Optimizing content for voice search can improve visibility on platforms like Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa.\n10. API-First Development\nAPI-first development is gaining popularity as it allows for greater flexibility and integration capabilities. By designing APIs before building the frontend or backend, developers can ensure that different parts of the application can communicate effectively.\nAccording to a survey by SmartBear, 54% of organizations are adopting an API-first approach to development.\n\"API-first development enables seamless integration and scalability, making it a cornerstone of modern web development.\" – Michael Lee, API Specialist at Integrated Web Solutions.\nConclusion\nStaying abreast of emerging technologies in web development is crucial for delivering cutting-edge web applications that meet the evolving needs of users. From PWAs and AI integration to WebAssembly and serverless architecture, these trends are shaping the future of the web. By leveraging these technologies, developers can create more efficient, secure, and engaging web experiences.\nFor businesses looking to implement these advanced technologies, partnering with an experienced development company can make all the difference.

    "extractedText": "How To Make Offshore Development Successful For Your Team\nCache Merrill\nCache Merrill, founder & CTO of Zibtek, is a tech leader in custom software development, sharing insights on trends, strategies, and product success.\nMore posts by Cache Merrill.\nCACHE MERRILL\n13 APR 2018 • 2 MIN READ\nCommunication – You know what you want. You know there are great developers halfway around the globe who can deliver what you want on the budget and timeline you need. You just don’t know how to get them to do it, what with linguistic barriers, time zone differences, and varied cultural approaches to the collaboration process getting in the way. These problems, if not addressed by having effective communication channels and practices in place, will eat away all of the cost and time savings outsourcing is supposed to bring. Communication with our offshore developers should involve three major features.\nOnshore Management for Offshore Devs\nThere’s simply no replacement for project leaders that share your culture, your language, and your timezone (or are at most only a few hours off). When management knows, in unequivocal terms, what the deliverables are and when they need to be delivered, the project flows more smoothly. You want to outsource your development, not your control or your awareness. A US-based project manager or management team will keep you informed and keep your development on track while allowing you to speak directly with your development personnel as needed. This split gives you the skill and savings on one hand and the confidence and ease of communication on the other—the best of both worlds.\nClear Communication Processes for All Project Members\nEveryone makes assumptions. Without them, we’d spend way too much time clarifying obvious details and micromanaging—or being micromanaged. Of course, assumptions vary from culture to culture, so sometimes greater clarity is needed. And any project that involves multiple teams working separately but in tandem needs excellent communication processes in place to sort out the easily-handled assumptions from those that need to be checked, and to do the checking. Clear expectations for all communications, from daily standups to demos of key milestones to sprint goals, will keep your project’s rhythm flowing and keep your development cycle turning smoothly.\nLong-Term Relationships with Your Outsourcing Team\nNothing beats experience, and the longer a partnership lasts the more seamless and reliable it becomes. You get to know the ins and outs of working together, and both you and your developers are able to get more value out of the collaboration. Though you might only have short-term or intermittent needs for an offshore development team, there are ways you can tap into the power of long-term relationships. Zibtek’s team brings US-based project managers and leaders together with a dedicated team of offshore developers, some of whom we’ve been working with for over 14 years. We know our team personally, we’re onsite with them regularly, and together we’ve completed over thirty MVPs in the past 18 months alone. Building the right communication with your offshore, outsourced developers can take time, or you can have it up and running in minutes with Zibtek.
